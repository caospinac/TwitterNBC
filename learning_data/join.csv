pos,"NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year. but  It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems."
pos,"NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year. but  It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems."
neg,"you cannot download the pictures off the phone, motomixer is not on the phone either"
neg,"I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software."
neg,"But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?"
neg,"It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems."
neg,"I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful."
neg,I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
neg,"After 4 attempted installs, I have finally given up."
neg,"During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so."
neg,"The MS scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar, over and over(up to 1 hr, I then shut it down and used GOBACK)."
neg,"The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself."
neg,I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
pos,NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year.
neg,"Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face."
neg,Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.
neg,"Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff."
neg,"As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating)."
neg,Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
pos,The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
neg,Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
pos,But that is good for me because Symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers.
neg,So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
neg,Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.
neg,Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
pos,"I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98."
pos,"Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected."
pos,"Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)"
neg,Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.
neg,This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
neg,"For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems."
pos,This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.
pos,"The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated."
pos,"I think their antivirus software was one of, if not the best, on the"
neg,"This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope."
neg,"They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all."
neg,The biggest problem is the installation.
neg,"Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security."
neg,"I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly."
neg,"First, it serious, serious installation problems."
neg,"Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run."
neg,"Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function."
neg,"First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates."
neg,"When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month."
neg,"The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions."
pos,"Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor)."
pos,"These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable."
neg,"But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate."
neg,The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
neg,"Warning! The Windows ""remove program"" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program."
neg,"A lot of ""fragments"" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders."
pos,"Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the ""Programs"" directory."
neg,"If you have an older version of ""Internet Security"" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install."
neg,You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
neg,"As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec."
neg,I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.
neg,"Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians."
neg,"The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars."
neg,"Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again."
neg,Avoid this product at all costs.
neg,"There are some highs to the 2004 edition, but mostly lows."
neg,"The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks."
neg,"I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a ""customer priority ID number."""
neg,"Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one."
neg,"So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs)."
neg,"And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority."
pos,Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
pos,I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
pos,Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
pos,You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
pos,The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
neg,Stay away from this product!
neg,"I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage."
neg,The customer support is pathetic.
neg,I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
neg,This product is absolutely not ready for release.
neg,"It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user."
neg,"I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud."
neg,It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
neg,Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
neg,Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
neg,"Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full."
neg,Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
neg,"So, DON'T buy this or upgrade."
neg,"If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't."
neg,"There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive."
neg,"If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version."
neg,"From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to ""ccApp.exe"" program running which is a Norton program."
neg,Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
neg,"We constantly got ""Windows Virtual Memory Low"" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes."
neg,Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
neg,Norton support is completely pathetic.
neg,DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
pos,We were able to obtain a Norton Corporate Edition of Antivirus only (no firewall or utilities) and so far it's great.
pos,I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
neg,"If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything."
neg,"Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok."
pos,"By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble."
pos,"Likewise, I've heard Norton 2004 PROFESSIONAL version is fine too."
neg,Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
neg,"I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!"
neg,"Seems the ""program scan"" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!"
neg,"Like most of their solutions (which first blame other applications for errors), the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT."
neg,It was a Symantec error.
neg,"After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window."
neg,I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
neg,"This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit."
pos,I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
neg,"Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions."
pos,Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
neg,The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
neg,"Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product."
pos,I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
neg,"The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem."
pos,"Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago."
neg,I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.
neg,"If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it."
neg,Can't get easier than that!
neg,"I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products."
pos,Mine installed no problem (but I DID uninstall my Norton Anti-Virus 2002 & Personal Firewall 2002 first).
pos,Seems to work great.
neg,"I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update."
neg,Booting up my computer took forever!!!
neg,"Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone."
neg,My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
neg,"Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep."
neg,After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...
neg,They didn't know what the problem could be.
neg,I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
neg,"Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help."
neg,"Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually."
neg,"You can ""disable"" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running."
neg,"Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there."
pos,This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
neg,But those 2 come up every time.
neg,"Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it."
neg,"Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault."
pos,"While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time."
neg,The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
neg,"When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!"
pos,"Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer."
pos,And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
neg,"I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download."
neg,Their site offers no live help at all.
neg,"I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number."
neg,Who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95? (I also bought the back-up CD).
neg,"I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice."
neg,"They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to ""handle"" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails."
neg,This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
neg,"After 10 years, I now downloaded McCaffee's product after calling their support....they answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful."
neg,"No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers."
neg,"I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!"
pos,"It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access."
neg,"I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004."
neg,"If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!"
pos,"Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing."
neg,"To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted."
neg,"If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly."
neg,"What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!"
pos,I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
neg,I am giving a zero star to symantec for this version!
pos,The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
neg,The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
neg,Symantec should give us all a refund and apology!
neg,"I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate, and neither should you."
pos,The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
pos,"No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus."
pos,"I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing)."
pos,This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
pos,5 stars all the way!
pos,All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
neg,"However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release."
neg,"While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system."
neg,"I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely."
neg,"The Antivirus is good, but ""Internet Security"" just isn't worth it."
pos,"I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance."
pos,This is also the case with NIS 2004.
pos,"I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable."
pos,"On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade."
pos,It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
pos,"The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --"
neg,"The installation, set-up, and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well."
neg,"HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC."
neg,"It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year."
neg,"I tried disabling the various components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service... and saw no improvement."
neg,There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
neg,"However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT."
pos,PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
pos,"I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue."
neg,"So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good."
neg,This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
neg,Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
neg,"I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!"
neg,It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)
pos,I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
neg,And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
pos,I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
neg,"It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM)."
neg,I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program.
neg,Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
neg,"I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt."
neg,"Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow."
neg,Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible.
neg,Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
neg,"While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with ""alerts"" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off."
neg,But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.
neg,"I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either."
neg,"I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required ""permissions"" and lacked proper administrator status."
neg,"Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident."
neg,"This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work."
neg,"I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have."
pos,Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.
pos,I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
neg,The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
neg,Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
pos,It has it all.
pos,"This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone."
pos,"If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you."
pos,"3660 had similar features, but that is big in size."
pos,6600 looks and feels nice.
pos,This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
pos,Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
pos,"I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great."
pos,"Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it."
pos,Goes ~3 days after a charge.
neg,I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
neg,I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
pos,I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.
pos,It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
pos,1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
pos,Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
pos,I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
pos,3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
pos,The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
pos,Capacity is not a problem here.
pos,4. The Build is just right.
pos,The phone is sturdy.
pos,I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
pos,Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
pos,"This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you."
pos,5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
pos,I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
pos,The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
pos,The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
pos,It has great upgradibility.
pos,"The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways."
pos,The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
neg,"Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants."
neg,The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
neg,Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
neg,You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
pos,This makes for a great phone.
neg,"I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone."
neg,"On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative."
neg,"As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on."
neg,"When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct."
neg,You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
neg,"I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny."
neg,It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
neg,"I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone."
neg,"This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer)."
neg,"My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above."
neg,who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
pos,"since then, i have not found one major problem with it."
pos,i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
neg,"Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features."
pos,"I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes."
pos,"Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting."
neg,"Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds."
neg,"Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth."
pos,This one has a good looking.
pos,It's oval and... nice.
pos,I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
pos,"It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big."
pos,"The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color."
neg,"And, other else,  the camera is still VGA."
neg,"I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application."
neg,"Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application."
pos,"Few month ago, it's very popular among my community."
pos,It's good.
neg,But not good enough for me.
pos,":! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool."
neg,"I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones."
pos,"While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used."
pos,What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
pos,1) Great audio quality overall.
pos,"Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality."
pos,"A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with."
pos,3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
neg,The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
pos,4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
pos,"If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else."
pos,"5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables."
pos,"6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic."
pos,"I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small."
neg,"My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long."
pos,"I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine."
pos,Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
neg,"OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface."
neg,The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
neg,Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
pos,APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
neg,"No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications."
pos,"The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more."
neg,"The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor."
pos,DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
pos,I've had no problems w/ this phone.
neg,"STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing."
neg,It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
pos,"Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big."
pos,"Solid, squeak-free, large screen."
pos,MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
pos,"First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc."
pos,"Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires."
pos,"The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850)."
pos,"The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia."
neg,The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
pos,"As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620."
pos,"The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness."
pos,"Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors."
pos,"It films 10 second video, for crying out loud."
neg,The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
neg,"Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space."
pos,There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
pos,A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
pos,"Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable."
neg,"When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow."
neg,BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
neg,"Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices."
neg,Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
neg,"This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free."
neg,"In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly."
neg,"Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved."
neg,The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.
pos,This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
pos,"It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software."
pos,I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
neg,"It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow."
neg,You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
neg,"Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go."
neg,"The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well."
pos,"The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness."
pos,"The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will."
pos,this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
pos,very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
neg,"This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people."
neg,The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
neg,The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
neg,"At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated."
pos,This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
pos,"I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless."
pos,"The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality."
neg,"I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse."
pos,I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
neg,This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
neg,This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
neg,My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.
neg,"In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece."
neg,Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
neg,"Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later ."
neg,"1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet ."
neg,2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
neg,"3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias ."
neg,"4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the ""other than phone"" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done ."
neg,"Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average ."
neg,"I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone ."
neg,"I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one ."
pos,I never had a single problem.
pos,It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
pos,High quality video and pictures rock!
pos,3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
pos,Bottom line great phone for the time being.
pos,"I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips."
pos,Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
pos,The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
pos,"The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite."
neg,Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
pos,"In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution."
pos,"I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone."
pos,You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
pos,Give each friend a different ringtone.
pos,Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
pos,A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
pos,"Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop."
pos,"Best phone i've ever owned, period."
pos,"Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used."
pos,"It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed."
pos,"Everything, so far, has worked flawlessly."
pos,"All at the same time, and all without a hitch."
pos,I think the interface is great.
pos,"I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO)."
pos,"I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc."
pos,"If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else."
pos,"UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front)."
pos,I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
pos,Photos are pretty darned good!
neg,DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
neg,My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
neg,"The ""movies"" last about 5 seconds."
neg,"I mean, they're short!"
neg,"I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it."
neg,"Also, when I dial an ""800"" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu."
neg,"Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me."
neg,It would not hang up on calls.
neg,"Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery."
pos,"Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs."
neg,"With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction."
pos,Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
neg,The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
pos,"This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile."
neg,They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
neg,"I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract."
pos,This phone is fantastic.
pos,"Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others)."
neg,Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate.
neg,T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
pos,I highly recommend this phone.
pos,I had a Sony ericsson T610 before this and the T610 is far inferior.
neg,"I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life."
pos,Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
pos,but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
neg,"yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!"
pos,i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!!
neg,"the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!"
pos,"the pics can be touched up in photoshop, and be printed at 4x6 and they look great!"
pos,i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
pos,"The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up."
pos,The phone itself is pretty nice.
pos,Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
neg,"Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional."
pos,This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.
neg,I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
pos,"I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)"
pos,The interface is simple to use.
neg,I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
pos,"I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal."
pos,I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
pos,The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
neg,On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
neg,Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
pos,As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
pos,"Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features."
pos,"For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well."
neg,On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
pos,"And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge."
pos,With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
pos,"The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera."
neg,"The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17."
pos,"The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones."
pos,"The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with."
pos,But you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.
pos,"Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect."
pos,"The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat."
pos,"This phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210"
pos,I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:
pos,1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.
pos,"2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures."
pos,3. Play Java games on it.
pos,4. Play N-Gage games on it.
pos,5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
pos,6. Play Gameboy Color games on it with GoBoy.
pos,7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.
pos,8. Connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company VPN at 56k speed via bluetooth.
pos,Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
pos,"As for bluetooth, no problems at all."
pos,I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
pos,Very simple and painless.
pos,"This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it."
pos,"Among my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support."
pos,The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
pos,"One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well."
pos,"If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter."
pos,I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
neg,"Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go."
pos,And the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal POP3/SMTP e-mail account.
neg,"I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use."
pos,The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
pos,Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
pos,You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
pos,The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
neg,I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
neg,"Sometimes, various applications crash."
neg,Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
neg,"This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)"
pos,"I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone."
neg,The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
neg,"It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it."
neg,"However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example."
neg,"Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name ""the bar of soap"" which, it really is."
pos,"But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue."
pos,"All in all, this is a great phone."
pos,Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).
pos,"If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you."
pos,I really love this phone...
neg,I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
neg,you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
neg,Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
pos,It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
pos,"I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest."
pos,The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
pos,I like the size and shape.
pos,It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
neg,The only problem is the size of the keys.
neg,My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
neg,They really are awfully small.
neg,Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
pos,It also works just fine for international calls.
pos,It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
pos,It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
neg,I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
pos,Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
pos,I never get dropped calls.
neg,It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
neg,I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
neg,"The Nokia 6600 is really just a glorified 3650: you know the 3650, those bulbous, formless, big phones a few unfortunate ATT customers are carrying around."
pos,"The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins."
pos,I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
pos,"I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else."
pos,Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
pos,"This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want."
neg,"The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone."
pos,"Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it."
neg,"Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate."
neg,These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
neg,For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
neg,There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
neg,Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
pos,"Initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera."
pos,"The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution."
pos,"2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception."
pos,"3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff."
neg,"Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage."
pos,"3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff."
neg,The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
neg,2) Phone is awfully slow.
neg,"Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two."
neg,"3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size."
neg,4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
neg,"There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters."
neg,"5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the ""Free picture and video messaging"" offered by service provider."
pos,"The bottom line is ""Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones""."
neg,"so, right out of the box i had issue."
neg,"namely, it wouldnt sync."
neg,after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
neg,"but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment."
pos,"if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson."
neg,if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
pos,"It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610."
pos,"speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !"
pos,"putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download."
neg,"DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard."
neg,and the battery life is bad !
neg,I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
neg,a bit dissapoitnd on that!
neg,the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
pos,I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
pos,Picture and video quality is ok.
pos,Love the speaker phone.
pos,INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
pos,"Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!"
pos,Picture quality's great for still and video with sound.
pos,you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
neg,you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
neg,T610 supports only midi files.
pos,"N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc."
pos,"it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!"
pos,I love this phone.
pos,This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
pos,"Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone."
pos,"You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :)."
pos,"Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks."
pos,"It uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s."
pos,Its nice look is also a plus.
neg,"And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists."
pos,"I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years."
neg,"Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset. "
neg,"After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files. "
neg,"SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me."
neg,"Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing."
pos,"All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD. "
pos,The base was deeper and the highs were crisper. 
neg,"Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it. "
pos,"what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!"
neg,This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.
neg,"Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!! "
neg,"Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a ""foreign"" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?  "
pos,"The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the ""stuff"" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it. "
neg,") Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive. "
neg,") WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord? "
neg,You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. 
neg,"I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. "
neg,I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. 
neg,") Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices. "
neg,"The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case. "
neg,"If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. . "
pos,") One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. "
pos,Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. .
pos,"The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. "
neg,"IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed. "
pos,") The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. . "
neg,"As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.     "
pos,"Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more."
pos,"Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  "
neg,"The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying."
pos,"I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  "
pos,"Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  "
pos,"Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  "
pos,"This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.        "
pos,"Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. "
neg,and supply those stupid white Headphones. 
pos,Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player. 
pos,"The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch. "
neg,The touch pad does take a little getting used to. 
pos,"The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.  "
pos,Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch. 
pos,It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges. 
pos,For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.
pos,I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it. 
pos,"1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  "
pos,The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience. 
neg,"The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). "
pos,It feels tiny in the hand without it. 
pos,The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk. 
pos,The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. 
neg,The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel. 
pos,The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   
pos,"Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. "
pos,The hardcase they give with it must work well.  
pos,It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.  
pos,"Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. "
pos,I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  
pos,Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.  
pos,Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. 
pos,The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. 
neg,"Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well. "
pos,Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  
neg,There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons. 
neg,"Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.     "
pos,I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.  
neg,"HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.  "
pos,"The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.  "
neg,"i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.  "
pos,"the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.  "
neg,"the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.  "
pos,"i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.  "
pos,"i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.  "
pos,"all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.       "
neg,"The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder. "
neg,NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.  
neg,"Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.  "
neg,This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.    
pos,The battery is removable. 
pos,FM radio built in (Howard Stern).  
pos,Record memos using the built in microphone.  
pos,The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it. 
pos,"The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.  "
pos,You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.    
pos,I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).   
neg,First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made. 
neg,"One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.  "
neg,"Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad. "
neg,"The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. "
neg,Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. 
neg,"The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having. "
neg,"If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to. "
pos,"However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter. "
neg,"Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. "
neg,"I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.   "
neg,"My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made."
pos,"While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player. "
pos,"Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.  "
pos,"I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc). "
pos,"And so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro. "
pos,"It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc). "
pos,The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface. 
pos,What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel. 
pos,"The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid. "
pos,The blue backlight is pretty cool. 
pos,"The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.  "
pos,"- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones. "
pos,"The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.  "
pos,- Replaceable battery. 
pos,"With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.  "
pos,"I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.  "
neg,"The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most. "
neg,"Even the ""shorter"" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way. "
pos,"If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.     "
pos,The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less. 
pos,"Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set. "
pos,"- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.  "
neg,Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod. 
neg,- The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. 
neg,"I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked. "
neg,"- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. - "
neg,I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode). 
neg,- Not compatible with Audible.com books.  
neg,"Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.     "
pos,Don't worry this player rocks.  
pos,It was also the most appealing.   
pos,"For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.  "
pos,It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.  
pos,"A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.  "
pos,I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.    
pos,Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices. 
pos,Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.  
pos,It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.  
pos,Everything shines of quality.  
pos,I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.  
pos,"I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.  "
pos,The interface works great.  
pos,I enjoy getting use to the touch pad. 
pos,In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.  
pos,What impressed me most was the sound.  
pos,At 128 the songs sound very good.  
pos,The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.  
pos,"The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.  "
pos,The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.  
pos,I absolutely love it. 
pos,It's so small. 
pos,It looks sleek and modern. 
pos,It holds plenty of songs. 
pos,The sound is amazing. 
pos,The menu is easy to use and understand. 
pos,I love the touchpade controls. 
pos,They're easy to use. 
pos,The radio and voice recording are nice. 
pos,The earbud headphones are really nice. 
pos,The battery has a long life. 
pos,It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course. 
pos,The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use. 
pos,It's faster than WMP. 
pos,So far I have no complaints with this player. 
pos,"If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player. "
pos,"It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.      "
pos,I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.   
pos,User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward. 
neg,PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all. 
neg,The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to. 
pos,You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).   
pos,Battery : A Big Big plus. 
pos,Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery. 
pos,Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours. 
pos,Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.  
pos,FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing. 
neg,Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works. 
pos,Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes. 
pos,Sound: This is where I love Zen the most. 
pos,Excellent sound I mean the player has juice. 
pos,The bass treble the sound detail is awsome. 
pos,"I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.  "
pos,Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool. 
pos,Its compact and has rounded edges. 
pos,Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.   
pos,"Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful. "
neg,I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem). 
neg,"You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.  "
neg,"What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design. "
pos,FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod. 
pos,"Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.  "
pos,"While I have not had the ""privilege"", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones."
pos,"By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.  "
pos,"While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.  "
pos,"About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to ""hip"" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the ""awkward"" factor.  "
pos,"It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.  "
pos,"The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.  "
pos,"Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.  "
pos,Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.  
pos,"Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.  "
pos,"All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.  "
neg,"P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.     "
neg,This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.  
neg,"The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  "
neg,"The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  "
neg,The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  
pos,"Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright. "
neg,After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player. 
neg,It seems like the software is just not responding. 
neg,"The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost. "
neg,"I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.     "
pos,"The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me. "
pos,"Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.  "
pos,"I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so. "
pos,"However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro. "
neg,"While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. "
pos,"As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song. "
pos,"I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc. "
pos,"After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.  "
neg,"If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.  "
neg,"It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general. "
neg,"The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.   "
neg,Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well. 
neg,"It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.   "
neg,"If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.      "
pos,"Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways. "
pos,"Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.  "
pos,"When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY! "
pos,"It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy! "
pos,The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus. 
pos,Moving on to sound department... It delivers! 
neg,"The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass. "
neg,"I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC. "
neg,"Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it. "
neg,"Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.  "
pos,"There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock. "
pos,"Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable! "
pos,"Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*. "
neg,It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music. 
pos,"Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes. "
pos,"It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.  "
pos,"Strong Points: - Design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish. "
pos,"You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a ""special edition"" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable. "
pos,"- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.  "
neg,- Radio Quality: weak reception     
neg,"It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than ""the other"" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  "
neg,"The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad. "
neg,But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  
neg,"What's the point of having ""good audio"" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  "
neg,Still has terrible software.  
neg,You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.  
neg,Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.  
pos,You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.  
neg,Screen review could be better.  
neg,Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.     
pos,This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price. 
pos,the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro. 
pos,It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately. 
pos,Creative did an awesome job with the design. 
pos,"The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. "
pos,I have the black one and adore it. 
pos,It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black. 
pos,I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred the size and style to the iPod mini. 
pos,"Overall, I've been very impressed with the player. "
pos,"I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date. "
pos,"I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors. "
pos,I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.  
pos,One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player. 
pos,"Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking. "
pos,"The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example). "
pos,"They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons. "
pos,"Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.  "
neg,"The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area. "
pos,"Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.  "
pos,"The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great. "
pos,"So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own. "
pos,They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers. 
pos,"This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  "
pos,"Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. "
pos,"The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense. "
pos,"The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that ""Creative"" branding is all over the place within it. "
pos,"Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time. "
pos,"On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. "
pos,"So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.  "
neg,"00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks. "
neg,"While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). "
neg,Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up. 
pos,"That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the ""Add to Cart"" button already!      "
pos,"Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. "
pos,"So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. "
neg,"After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty). "
neg,"Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!"
neg,They obviously have quality and reliability problems. 
neg,"They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  "
pos,"ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! "
pos,This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  
pos,"I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  "
neg,"es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  "
pos,"I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  "
neg,Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  
neg,My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  
neg,"Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  "
neg,The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  
neg,"It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  "
pos,I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  
neg,It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.  
pos,"The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.  "
pos,The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.  
neg,"On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !"
neg,is not as intuitive as I would like.  
neg,"Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.  "
pos,"Overall, I am very pleased with it.  "
pos,"The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.     "
pos,"Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.  "
pos,The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds. 
pos,The player is smaller than you think. 
neg,"The touch pad is over-sensitive, and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive. "
pos,"Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.     "
neg,"The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL. "
neg,"After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out. "
neg,"I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail. "
neg,"Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless. "
neg,his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?  
pos,The Zen Micro is near perfect.   
pos,"It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   "
pos,The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.   
pos,"It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!"
neg,It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it. 
pos,The accesories that come with the player are great. 
pos,"White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag. "
pos,best in class. 
pos,"It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.   "
pos,"Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.   "
pos,Pick your favorite color and buy it.      
neg,"As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front. "
neg,"Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to ""unhold"" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player. "
neg,"After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). "
neg,"Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this. "
pos,"Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. "
pos,"It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  "
pos,"The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    "
neg,"Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game. "
pos,"If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  "
pos,"anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing. "
pos,the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does. 
pos,+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
pos,+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right? 
pos,"+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for. "
neg,It DOES take some getting used to. 
neg,whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side. 
neg,It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working? 
neg,-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website. 
neg,) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long. 
pos,"But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.  "
pos,"Overall though, i'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player, even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the iPod. ;)     "
pos,"I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.  "
pos,And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.  
pos,It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.   
pos,"After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.   "
pos,The sound is very nice.  
pos,"I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.   "
neg,"I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.   "
neg,"Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.  "
pos,"Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.    "
pos,"However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior. "
pos,"I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones. "
pos,"I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on. "
neg,"I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now. "
pos,Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download. 
pos,"Its also smaller, and gets more looks. "
pos,"An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook. "
pos,This is really a no brainer. 
pos,"I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.  "
neg,The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want. 
neg,"Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  charging[-2] "
pos,Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility. 
pos,"Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  "
pos,"The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  "
pos,"If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  "
pos,This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.  
pos,I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.  
pos,"Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore. "
neg,"If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while. "
neg,A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it. 
pos,"On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.  "
pos,"The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.    "
pos,"The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.  "
pos,"No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.    "
pos,"I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.  "
neg,"Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.  "
neg,It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.  
neg,"The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.  "
neg,"Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.    "
pos,Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.  
pos,"eball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.  "
neg,"Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.          "
pos,"Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.  "
pos,Sound quality? Phenomenal. 
pos,"unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.  "
pos,Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.  
pos,Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums. 
pos,Tough as nails. 
pos,"No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two."
pos,Flawless. 
pos,) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.  
pos,"The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player. "
pos,Gets nice sound too. 
pos,The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.  
pos,"In conclusion, this player is beautiful. "
pos,"Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate. "
pos,But it; you won't regret it.     
pos,"This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.  "
pos,"The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.  "
pos,"The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.  "
pos,"The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!  "
pos,"I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!  "
pos,The blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.  
pos,"t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?      "
pos,I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  
pos,"it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  "
pos,I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  
pos,Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  
neg,where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  
neg,"I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  "
pos,The extra Gb is just a bonus.  
neg,"The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of ""ear buds"".  "
pos,"If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.     "
neg,Unfortunately I was wrong.  
neg,"Within one month, my player completely died. "
neg,"(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked. "
neg,"So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.  "
neg,I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.  
neg,I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.  
pos,It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.  
neg,"It's too bad, though, that !"
pos,"The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers. "
pos,The Zen offered a great alternative. 
pos,"It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch. "
pos,"The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!"
pos,"Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either. "
neg,"The included headphones suck, so get your own.         "
pos,Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software. 
pos,"The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod. "
pos,The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info. 
pos,"Track $, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen. "
pos,"rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well. "
neg,"The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies. "
neg,"just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two. "
pos,"Oh, and another is the cool ""halo"" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer. "
neg,"But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.         "
pos,"One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs). "
pos,"Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!"
neg,"But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything. "
neg,"because the ""engineers"" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack. "
neg,"Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage. "
neg,"Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!"
neg,The flaw is inside the Zen. 
neg,The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to. 
neg,"The Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer. "
neg,Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???  
pos,"This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features. "
neg,"To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC. "
neg,"I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.  "
neg,This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files. 
neg,"The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.  "
neg,"Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.  "
pos,"Otherwise, this is a great ""alternative"" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple. "
pos,"I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it. "
pos,I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  
pos,The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  
pos,"It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  "
pos,"Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  "
pos,"I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned. "
pos,"However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.   "
pos,"Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs. "
pos,"sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!  "
pos,"As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'. "
pos,This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another. 
pos,"These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted. "
pos,"By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.     "
neg,"I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.  "
neg,"Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.  "
pos,"When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.   "
pos,"This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it. "
pos,"It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up. "
pos,"By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do. "
pos,"It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is. "
pos,It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house. 
pos,"There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it. "
pos,"Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!     "
neg,"It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.  "
neg,The Wizard is particularly sinister. 
neg,"It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC. "
neg,"The box proudly displays ""SecureEasySetup (TM)"" ""Wireless Made Simple"" ""One Touch Setup Button"" ""Easy Start"" ""Easy Security"" ""Easy Everyday""   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial. "
pos,I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself. 
neg,"HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup. "
neg,Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac. 
neg,I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless. 
neg,The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac. 
neg,"I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!"
neg,What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS!
neg,* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable. 
pos,But the product iself is great.  
pos,"Once you set it up, it's great. "
neg,And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting. 
pos,Another 5 star performance. 
pos,This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time. 
pos,Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room. 
pos,This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte. 
pos,I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
pos,Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies. 
pos,Installation was as near automatic as can be. 
pos,All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment. 
neg,I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA. 
pos,Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.  
pos,New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration. 
pos,All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network. 
pos,"Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.  "
pos,Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router. 
pos,You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.  
neg,Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco. 
neg,"There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.  "
neg,The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.  
pos,The router works fine for both wired and wireless.  
pos,I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.  
pos,"Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.  "
neg,"little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.  "
pos,"I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.     "
neg,This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment. 
pos,I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it. 
neg,The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half. 
pos,"just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it. "
pos,"I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.     "
neg,I tried the CD setup program without any luck.  
neg,"Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem. "
neg,"Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.  "
pos,"It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.  "
pos,"This is my fourth Linksys product and, aside from the rough start, I'm very satisfied with this router.     "
pos,This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE. 
pos,"The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard."
pos,I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!! 
pos,It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems. 
pos,there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth. 
pos,And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow. 
pos,A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years. 
pos,"I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed. "
neg,"However, this product performed well below my expectation.  "
neg,"The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.  "
neg,"After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).  "
pos,"As I mentioned in my first paragraph, it supports WPA security, which is far superior to WEP.  "
pos,In addition it is very easy to setup.  
pos,"anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.  "
pos,So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections.  
pos,The setup was very easy. 
pos,"Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time. "
pos,The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.   
pos,drops and strong signals even from the backyard. 
pos,The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.  
pos,"Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys. "
pos,The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.      
pos,I got it working fast enough.  
pos,It is a nice router in all ways but one.  
neg,It is not reliable.  
neg,A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet. 
neg,"That is, you cannot access the internet at all.  "
neg,Very annoying.    
pos,I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.  
neg,The installation software CD crashed repeatedly. 
neg,"I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.   "
neg,I couldn't get the install wizard to work.  
pos,"However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze.  "
pos,It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.  
neg,Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.     
pos,"While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.  "
pos,The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process. 
pos,"Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable. "
pos,"Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!"
pos,at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.     
pos,"It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.  "
pos,Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
pos,Setup in XP was instant and intuitive. 
pos,The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients. 
pos,Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.     
pos,My experience with installation was quite good.  
pos,I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).  
pos,"The card basically installed itself and the ""install wizard"" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).  "
neg,"The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.  "
pos,"I haven't tried to set up any advanced features on the router, but it is not difficult to set up for basic use.  "
pos,The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.  
pos,"I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners, seldom falling below the ""very good"" range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router.  "
pos,"The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.  "
pos,"I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the ""mixed mode"" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.     "
pos,As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market. 
neg,"I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit, and some wanted features, like a list of computers accessing my wireless, is not easily found on my router.   "
pos,"All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one. "
pos,"I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.  "
pos,All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.     
pos,"This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year. "
pos,"My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now. "
pos,IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....     
pos,"I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product!"
neg,"It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song ""Piece Of Cr--!"", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.  "
neg,"There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the ""knowledge"" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.  "
pos,I just upgraded to the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G router last month and I am very happy with the quality of the product.  
pos,"This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.  "
neg,I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection. 
pos,The inital setup of the router was simple. 
pos,Works pretty well. 
pos,The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server. 
neg,"This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.  "
neg,"I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.     "
pos,My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic. 
neg,"Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.  "
pos,Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.  
pos,"ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.  "
pos,This model appears to be especially good.  
neg,I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek. 
pos,The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too. 
pos,"If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.             "
pos,"The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge. "
pos,"To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins. "
pos,The setup software did everything. 
pos,In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router. 
pos,A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality. 
pos,I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler. 
pos,I am getting better speeds on all my web programs. 
pos,There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router. 
neg,"I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy. "
neg,"The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys. "
neg,The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually. 
neg,"This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!"
pos,"It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys. "
neg,The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.  
pos,Pros.1.Speed  2. Signal Strength  3.Advanced Configuration Options
neg,So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.  
neg,Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best. 
neg,Stay away from this junk. 
pos,"Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.  "
pos,"In fact, it supports the new WPA encryption standard, which is WAY better than WEP.  "
pos,Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA. 
pos,"Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.     "
neg,Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac. 
pos,"Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm. "
neg,The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g. 
pos,"However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.  "
pos,"Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.     "
neg,"(...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging. "
pos,"For more than a year, and it is totally reliable.  "
pos,"No down time, great signal strength.  "
pos,There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.  
pos,Setup is totally breeze and Linksys's web site is pretty easy to navigate.  
neg,Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.  
pos,The fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion. 
pos,So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html      
pos,Absolutely no problems with this router. 
pos,"I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions. "
pos,A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.  
pos,Speed is not a problem.      
pos,After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine. 
pos,"As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.     "
pos,"Getting the router setup in a ""vanilla"" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem."
pos,"Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly. "
pos,"I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router. "
neg,"The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4. "
neg,"Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with ""MAC settings"", etc. "
pos,"When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage. "
pos,"Having done all this, I was quite pleased to see that all corners I needed were decently covered by the signal. "
pos,"The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard. "
pos,"Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc. "
pos,the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.     
neg,We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.  
neg,It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.  
neg,The tech support is worthless too.     
neg,"There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games."
pos,SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.
neg,"It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod. "
pos,The bass is deep and the treble is clear.
neg,"DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months."
neg,"Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE."
neg,"Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily."
neg,"Also, not liking the gel case. "
neg,"FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature. "
neg,"There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners. "
neg,"There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't."
neg,"There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more."
pos,"EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one."
neg,I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software. 
neg,"CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier. "
neg,There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
neg,"OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average. "
pos,The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company. 
pos,"Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!     "
pos,I have an ipod and it is a great buy. 
pos,Very sturdy and strong.
neg,Doesn't have alot of good games on it.
neg,"iPod is brilliant, but service was awful"
pos,"The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod. "
pos,This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.  
pos,"The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users."
neg,"The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. "
pos,"Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge. "
pos,Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products. 
pos,"The product I rate five stars, "
neg,but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
pos,"Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.  "
neg,The interface took a little getting used to.
pos,"This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual. "
pos,"I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous. "
pos,The sound is just fine. 
pos,"It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.  "
neg,One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
pos,Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable. 
pos,"Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2"" "
pos,"Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.  "
pos,"FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync."
pos,"Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus. "
pos,"Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy "
pos,"Games-- not really important, but existant "
pos,"Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket. "
neg,Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
neg,3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.
neg,"No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient"
pos,". iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod. "
neg,"No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium."
pos,"Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market."
pos,Versatile and stylish.         
pos,"I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.   "
neg,"The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').   "
pos,The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed  
pos,"The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.      "
neg,"First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself. "
neg,"In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge."
pos,"I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality."
pos,"Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.  "
pos,"As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough. "
pos,"In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly."
neg,*The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily. 
neg,The Battery does not last 12 hours.  
neg,"You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so."
neg,"*        You can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *        "
neg,"My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of ""brick."" *"
neg,"If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for ""abusing"" your ipod."
neg,The user support service isn't too great either.  
pos,Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
pos,"Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market. "
pos,"Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.  "
pos,"Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer. "
pos,"There's even an equalizer (under ""settings"") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, ""deep"", and electronic."
pos,"With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster. "
neg,"The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so. "
pos,ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.    
neg,"Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.  "
pos,"All in all, this is a wonderful device.  "
neg,"The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel. "
neg,Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!        
neg,"The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches."
pos,"Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.  "
neg,"Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services. "
pos,Battery non-issue. 
pos,"Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use. "
pos,The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.
pos,This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
pos,"The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast."
pos,The Great And Versatile iPod         I love my iPod! 
pos,"The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out. "
neg,"As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance. "
pos,"I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt."
pos,The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use. 
neg,"My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up. "
pos,"(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!     "
pos,"Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod."
pos,"And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own."
neg,"If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong."
pos,However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority. 
pos,"For a sleeker, smaller and more ""average"" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful."
neg,"Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT. "
pos,The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
pos,"The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days). "
pos,"The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc."
pos,The!  sound quality is great. 
pos,The included earphones are pretty good - my advice? 
pos,The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
pos,"With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive. "
pos,"Also included in the ""games"" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs. "
pos,"20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a ""dock station"" and double storage space (10,000 songs)."
pos,"Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it."
pos,"Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it."
pos,"Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music."
pos,It all sounds great too. 
neg,"As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears. "
pos,You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.
neg,Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY. 
neg,This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
neg,"However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS. "
neg,LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.  
neg,"The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches."
neg,"BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around."
pos,"If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one. "
pos,So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
pos,"For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod. "
pos,"The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player. "
neg,"Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.  "
neg,"We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party ""iSkin"" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks."
neg,"First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable."
pos,"These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one."
neg,"And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.  "
pos,"Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything. "
pos,The player is great. 
neg,"However, the battery life isn't as good as I would like. "
pos,"Overall, this product is AWESOME. "
pos,"All the ""cool"" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.  "
pos,Really easy to use.
pos,Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
pos,Has a great helpline.
pos,They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
neg,"They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices."
neg,Cons Breaks easily. 
neg,Hard drive screws up occasionally
neg,The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used. 
pos,"I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives. "
pos,This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now. 
pos,"I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes. "
pos,"I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound."
neg,"This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see. "
pos,I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it. 
neg,The only problem is the battery life.
neg,Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100! 
pos,The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.  
pos,I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.  
pos,"The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing. "
pos,"The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.  "
pos,"I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.  "
pos,Way to go Apple!  
pos,"I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, ""I WANT THAT ONE!"" I was willing to shell out "
pos,I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
neg,"The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob."
neg,The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
neg,"Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely."
pos,"From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price."
pos,But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
pos,"The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)"
neg,"However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table)."
pos,"Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it."
neg,"The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table."
neg,"Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits."
pos,"The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA."
neg,"If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita."
neg,It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
pos,"But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record."
neg,I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
pos,So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
pos,Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
neg,"It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation."
pos,In my table the M12V has been a real champ.
pos,The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
neg,"With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls)."
pos,"Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price"
neg,"Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4"" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping"
pos,This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
pos,"Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig."
pos,The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
neg,"It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired."
pos,"The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate."
pos,This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
pos,"The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy."
neg,"The only complaint I have is that the 1/4"" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4"" bits."
neg,The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.
pos,"This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine."
pos,Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.
pos,I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
pos,The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.
pos,The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
pos,The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
pos,"It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use."
neg,The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
neg,The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
neg,"Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance."
pos,Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.
pos,This is an excellent router for the money.
neg,The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
neg,I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
pos,"Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money."
pos,I must have gotten a good one.
pos,"I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4"" sleeve yet) ."
pos,I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
pos,No vibration!
pos,Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.
pos,It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
pos,It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
pos,Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.
pos,The soft start is nice.
pos,The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)
pos,The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
pos,Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
pos,Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
pos,"UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table."
pos,Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
pos,It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
neg,1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
neg,"Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars)."
neg,"I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention."
neg,"Not a killer problem, but not well done, either."
pos,"For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result."
pos,Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
pos,After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
pos,"On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well."
pos,"I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances."
neg,The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
neg,If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..
pos,What an upgrade!!!
pos,"I have only used it with the 1/4"" collet and a 1/2"" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly."
pos,The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
pos,The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
pos,"Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy."
pos,"I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!"
pos,I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
pos,"I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut."
pos,It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
pos,Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
pos,I prefer things that are simple.
pos,"The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to."
neg,I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
neg,I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
neg,"I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it."
neg,I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.
pos,Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.
pos,I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.
pos,It is quiet and has plenty of power.
pos,I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
neg,"That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism."
neg,"Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking."
neg,"After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while."
neg,"I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router."
neg,"If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router."
neg,"If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere."
pos,I love the performance and features of this router.
pos,"For the money, I'm not sure you can do better."
pos,"It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great."
pos,Smooth plunging mechanism.
pos,The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
neg,"It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up."
pos,"Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer."
pos,I purchased two of these beauties.
pos,I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
pos,One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
pos,The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
pos,They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
pos,I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
pos,"The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole."
pos,I would however highly recommend the m12v router !
pos,I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
pos,The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results.
pos,Its well made and user friendly.
pos,You'll love it!
pos,It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
pos,This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.
pos,I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
pos,"It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish."
pos,"For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup."
pos,You just can't go wrong with this one!
pos,Enjoy.
pos,This is an excellent router for the price.
pos,The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
pos,This is a well-made and powerful tool.
neg,I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
pos,The M12V has been great.
pos,The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
pos,The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
pos,"What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking."
neg,This router was a huge disapointment.
neg,The depth adjustment was sloppy.
neg,The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.
neg,It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
neg,My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
pos,I did like the heft of the machine.
neg,It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
neg,"I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective."
neg,"All in all, not very good."
neg,I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.
pos,"The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter."
pos,The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
neg,"The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately."
pos,"I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!"
pos,"The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router."
pos,"I recently had to run a 3/4"" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down."
pos,"I could take 1/2"" passes and it still didn't skip a beat."
pos,"I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder."
pos,"Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal."
pos,I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
pos,"It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite."
pos,"The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare."
pos,I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
pos,"If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget."
pos,I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
pos,I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
pos,It doesn't bog down under load.
pos,Cuts are easy and smooth.
pos,"I use it on a router table, and it is works well."
neg,"The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well."
neg,I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.
neg,"Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well."
neg,The sliding latch is does not stay in place.
pos,"Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again."
pos,I really liked the price...
pos,I like the speed control.
pos,It has plenty of power.
neg,The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.
neg,"Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier."
neg,"I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the ""sliding wrench"" which comes on the router."
pos,All in all I am pleased with the router.
pos,"The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced."
neg,"It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be."
neg,Recenly the variable speed control went out.
neg,It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
neg,"The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated."
pos,Overall it is a great value.
pos,For the price I don't think you can beat it.
pos,This is a fantastic tool to use.
neg,Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
pos,"This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China."
neg,They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.
neg,My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.
pos,When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.
neg,"Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger."
neg,"Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working."
neg,You must keep double checking depths.
pos,"But, for the money it is a good machine."
neg,"Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years."
neg,The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
pos,"For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy."
pos,"For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit."
neg,"If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!"
pos,"Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags."
pos,"So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all."
pos,It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
pos,"I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills."
pos,The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
pos,There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
pos,We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
neg,Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!
pos,We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
pos,It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
pos,I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
neg,"The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth."
neg,"In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless."
neg,My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
pos,"If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie."
pos,It's far better than all others on the market.
pos,it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
pos,There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
pos,1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
pos,3. It never smelled - at all.
pos,"The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby."
neg,Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.
neg,It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
pos,This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
neg,The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
pos,This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers.
neg,"I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail."
neg,My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
neg,The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
neg,"This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie."
pos,"It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?"
pos,It also holds a lot more diapers.
pos,look at the size of it!
neg,I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
pos,I highly recommend this!
neg,For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
pos,I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.
pos,I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
pos,It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
pos,The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
neg,"But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function."
neg,"(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full."
pos,I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
pos,The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
pos,And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
pos,"And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!"
pos,"If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!"
pos,THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
pos,Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
pos,"It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!"
pos,"It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!)."
pos,It's also easy to empty out.
pos,"And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!"
pos,"Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!"
pos,"Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!"
neg,Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.
pos,"Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills."
neg,"As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the ""plunger"" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full."
pos,"But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying."
pos,"This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift."
pos,Go for the Champ.
pos,I love this product!
pos,"With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones."
pos,"Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great."
pos,No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
pos,and we still LOVE it!
pos,*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
pos,(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
pos,*holds the odor in nicely!
pos,"(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag."
pos,We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.
pos,"It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily."
pos,"I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special ""diaper"" trash bags necessary."
neg,"The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved."
pos,It works with a minimum of fuss.
pos,"The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that."
pos,This is one of the best purchases we made.
pos,"Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous."
pos,"Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!"
pos,"There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ."
pos,I love this pail!
pos,"No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!"
neg,Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell.
neg,"I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky."
pos,I think it's great.
neg,I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
pos,It definitely keeps the smell out.
neg,But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
pos,First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.
neg,But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.
pos,The diaper champ is the best!
pos,"I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ."
pos,1) The champ is easy to use.
pos,With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.
pos,It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
pos,2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
pos,You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
pos,3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.
pos,The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
neg,The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
pos,"Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go."
pos,Let the Champ win you over!
pos,No need for deodorizers.
pos,I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
pos,even did while daughter sleep and no noise!
pos,I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
pos,This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
neg,"We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used."
neg,We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
neg,We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
pos,"But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie."
pos,"It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work."
pos,"At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!"
pos,"Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ."
pos,It is mindless to operate.
pos,"It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon)."
pos,And it is very easy to clean.
pos,"I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple."
pos,This is a great diaper pail.
pos,There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
pos,"(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie)."
pos,And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
pos,and we definitely prefer our Champ!
pos,"Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity."
neg,it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.
neg,The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
neg,"I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed."
neg,"For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it."
neg,The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.  
neg,"All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews."
pos,I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
pos,It works great.
pos,"I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby)."
pos,I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
pos,We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
pos,"It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife)."
pos,"It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle."
pos,We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).
pos,"It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!"
pos,"Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)"
pos,"I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags."
neg,Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
pos,THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
pos,I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!
pos,No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
pos,"In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ."
neg,2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!
pos,SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
neg,"Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!"
pos,"All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price."
pos,"I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills."
neg,The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
neg,"I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared."
neg,"That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!"
neg,It still smelled.
neg,Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
pos,Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
pos,"The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over."
pos,"Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over."
neg,CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
neg,"Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up."
neg,Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first. 
pos,I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
neg,The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
neg,The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.
neg,I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
pos,This is a GREAT product!
neg,I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
pos,The Champ works great.
pos,We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
pos,We've never experienced odor from the pail.
pos,"It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion."
pos,I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
pos,Excellent diaper disposal unit.
pos,I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
pos,A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
pos,Diaper Champ is great.
pos,"So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!"
pos,"Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it."
pos,"It works easily with one hand, which is important."
pos,"Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock."
pos,"While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets."
neg,"Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore."
neg,"Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston."
neg,I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
neg,Also much less stinky.
neg,Don't buy the diaper champ.
pos,I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
pos,"I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far."
pos,This one is really great.
pos,I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
pos,Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
pos,The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!
pos,We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
pos,We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
pos,We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.
pos,This is really a nice diaper pail.
pos,I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
pos,"In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room."
pos,Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
pos,I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
pos,1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
pos,We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
pos,We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
pos,2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.
pos,So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
pos,The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
pos,3.  Bags are easy to change.
neg,"Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone."
neg,To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.
pos,Works great!!!!
pos,5.  The price is right.
pos,I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
pos,"I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen."
neg,The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
neg,"I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while."
neg,A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
neg,"Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,"
pos,I'd say that this camera is perfect.
pos,"OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it."
pos,"I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size."
pos,"It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera."
pos,"it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable."
pos,"There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched."
pos,"The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!"
pos,The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
neg,"First off, the battery."
neg,"This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there."
neg,"Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short."
neg,"This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine."
neg,Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
neg,Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
neg,The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
neg,"Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up."
neg,The flash is very weak.
neg,The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
neg,The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
neg,"To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem."
pos,"The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot."
neg,"it's not my first choice in cameras,"
pos,"I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size."
pos,"If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice."
pos,"after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100."
pos,"It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths."
neg,1) It is perhaps too small. 
neg,I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
neg,Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
neg,2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots. 
neg,This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
neg,"3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card"
neg,4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
neg,It is hot enough to be annoying.
pos,This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
pos,It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
pos,This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
pos,Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
pos,Hate to wait between shots
pos,Download it fast to your computer
pos,Have a great and easy to use bundled software
pos,Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
pos,"FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD"
pos,The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
pos,I love this camera.
pos,"I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it."
neg,"It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever."
pos,I am very pleased with my purchase.
pos,I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
pos,This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
pos,"It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow."
pos,"Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste)."
pos,"Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc."
neg,"The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint."
pos,"The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality."
pos,It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
neg,I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
neg,I then realized a major design flaw.
neg,All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
neg,"When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !"
pos,"I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic)."
neg,The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
neg,The digital zoom is crap.
pos,It fits in your pocket.
pos,The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
neg,The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
pos,You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
pos,The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
neg,The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
pos,"It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a ""Normal"" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom."
neg,The price is $... more.
neg,I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
neg,The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
neg,The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
pos,But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
pos,I love this camera!
neg,"the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!"
pos,I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
pos,I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
pos,I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
pos,I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
pos,But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
pos,"A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:"
pos,I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
pos,"The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good)."
pos,"But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100."
pos,"This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240."
pos,"This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting."
pos,The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
pos,The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
neg,My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
neg,"I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!"
pos,"Other than that, I love this camera."
pos,The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
pos,The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
pos,"If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design."
pos,"The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack."
pos,"I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it."
pos,"I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities."
pos,"This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job."
pos,I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
pos,"I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!"
pos,"First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software."
pos,"The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it."
pos,"The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder."
neg,"All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera."
pos,"They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great."
neg,"When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin."
neg,Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
neg,I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
pos,"I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!"
pos,"First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper."
pos,"Second, it is  incredibly easy to use."
pos,"I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)"
pos,"The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot."
pos,"The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off."
pos,I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
pos,"At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph."
pos,"It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography."
pos,"Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket."
pos,"I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use."
pos,"I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking)."
pos,Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
pos,The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
pos,The metal housing seems very rugged.
neg,I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
neg,"For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that."
neg,The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
neg,The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
pos,"The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus."
pos,"The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery."
pos,The panorama modes are wonderful.
pos,"It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere."
pos,In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
pos,The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
pos,There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
pos,1- Small.
pos,VERY smal.
pos,"I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket."
pos,2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
pos,4- Looks great.
pos,Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
pos,5- Excelent software package.
pos,6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
pos,Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
pos,7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
neg,"8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything."
neg,"Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany."
pos,"i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!"
pos,I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
pos,"This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing."
pos,Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
pos,The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
pos,The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
pos,"This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example."
pos,"So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality? size[+2]"
pos,"After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures."
pos,I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
pos,"The size is tiny, which I love."
neg,"Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 ""adjust levels"" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though."
pos,This camera is so easy to use!
pos,"All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me."
pos,"The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere."
pos,"I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point."
pos,"I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this."
pos,You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
pos,We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500. 
pos,It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested. 
neg,"A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition. "
pos,The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality. 
neg,"I thought given all the ""10"" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey. "
neg,I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen. 
neg,"When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless. "
pos,This camera is truely superb.
pos,"The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding."
neg,Some more manual control would have been nice. 
pos,They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact. 
pos,I went out and got the Canon today. 
pos,"I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!! "
neg,"The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion. "
pos,"I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down. "
pos,Sharper pictures. 
pos,"The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly. "
pos,"It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot. "
neg,The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered. 
pos,Good image quality. 
pos,"All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time."
neg,"After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem. "
neg,After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings. 
pos,Camera is a paper weight. 
pos,I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
pos,"The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire. "
pos,"Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on. "
pos,"I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card). "
neg,you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with. 
pos,"Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions. "
pos,The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got. 
neg,"The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can. "
neg,I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature. 
neg,Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls. 
pos,Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality. 
pos,"My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not ""whine"" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp. "
pos,This camera is bulletproof. 
pos,start up is so quick ? 
pos,you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally! 
pos,"big lcd screen - at least for me, 2"" is enough"
pos,"great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great. "
pos,"when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better "
pos,"digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture"
pos,great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one). 
pos,"i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)"
pos,photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
pos,turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date. 
neg,battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal. 
neg,the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera. 
pos,i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures. 
pos,"if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading "
pos,it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
pos,"if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer. "
pos,they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
pos,"I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money. "
neg,Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash. 
pos,"If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen."
pos,"All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price. "
pos,Having the Digic II chip helps a lot. 
pos,This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat. 
pos,I still can't believe how fast it starts up. 
pos,I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice. 
pos,"I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy. "
pos,"I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit. "
neg,"As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt."
neg,"The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice. "
neg,I took it out one day and the LCD was not working. 
neg,"Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall."
pos,"I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing. "
pos,The size of the camera is perfect. 
pos,Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket. 
pos,there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things. 
pos,"I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality. "
pos,The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent. 
pos,I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera. 
pos,"This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot. "
pos,The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
pos,"I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great. "
pos,The photo quality is amazing. 
pos,"it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too. "
pos,I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
pos,As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen. 
pos,another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
pos,"Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go. "
pos,"As it turns out, this is an awesome camera! "
pos,"However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes. "
neg,"I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel. "
pos,The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed. 
pos,"Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!"
pos,"I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality. "
pos,"Very good ""every day"" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos."
pos,"If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you! "
pos,am so glad I bought this camera. 
pos,All the good reviews for the SD500 are true. 
pos,The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer. 
pos,The included software removes any red eye easily. 
pos,"if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500. "
pos,This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used. 
pos,Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect. 
neg,The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click. 
neg,The buttons are rather stiff. 
pos,I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot. 
neg,"overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance."
pos,"Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight. "
pos,"When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive. "
pos,"In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes). "
neg,Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
pos,"I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well)."
pos,I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results. 
pos,Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro. 
pos,Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings. 
pos,The manual is excellent. 
pos,"Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast."
pos,Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures. 
pos,Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds. 
pos,I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
pos,I love the camera.
pos,This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation. 
pos,The camera responce is VERY quick. 
pos,"I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face. "
pos,And the video quality is amazing. 
pos,And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30. 
neg,I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites. 
neg,There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens. 
neg,"The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark. "
neg,The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
pos,"there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box . "
neg,"after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! "
pos,"i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &$38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route . "
pos,"my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared . "
pos,"the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise . "
pos,"the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers . "
neg,the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint . 
neg,"after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent . "
pos,"here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy . "
pos,"it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio ! "
neg,"i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable . "
neg,the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine ! 
neg,"the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) . "
neg,the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be . 
neg,"the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this -- "
neg,"the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly . "
neg,"the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) . "
neg,the volume . 
neg,i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet . 
pos,"on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life . "
pos,"i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it . "
neg,"i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous . "
neg,"also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works . "
neg,"since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" . "
neg,"i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked . "
neg,"apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands . "
pos,"in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions . "
pos,"t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's . "
neg,"however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line . "
pos,"i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional . "
pos,"while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it . "
pos,i highly recommend a nokia 6610 . 
pos,no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers . 
pos,"from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone . "
pos,"whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio . "
pos,i treat the battery well and it has lasted . 
neg,the volume level of the phone is not all that good . 
neg,"some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to . "
neg,the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . 
neg,the vibration is not top . 
pos,overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned . 
neg,"great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like . "
neg,i am bored with the silver look . 
pos,it has a nice color screen . 
pos,it is small . 
neg,"radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in . "
neg,t-mobile was a pretty good server . 
neg,they are not wowable good . 
neg,it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! ! 
neg,"this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it . "
neg,we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use . 
neg,"when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there : "
pos,"while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece . "
neg,"negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button . "
neg,poor visibility on the keys . 
pos,"the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ... "
neg,only con i can think of is no camera ... . 
pos,this phone is a winner ... 
pos,"anything this phone does , it does perfectly . "
pos,"the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly . "
pos,this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone . 
pos,as said before this works perfectly . 
pos,you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . 
pos,the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly . 
pos,you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly . 
neg,"only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing . "
pos,this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in . 
pos,"this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly . "
pos,i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . 
neg,the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile . 
pos,anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception . 
pos,another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . 
pos,this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . 
pos,"when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light . "
pos,"this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . "
pos,the battery life on this phone is surreal . 
pos,i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . 
pos,it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light . 
pos,"this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial . "
neg,"the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do . "
pos,"overall , i highly recommend this phone . "
pos,it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package . 
pos,size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you . 
pos,"sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored . "
pos,speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch . 
pos,"surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available . "
neg,"ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring . "
neg,the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out . 
neg,games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games . 
pos,nice little phone ... light compact . . 
neg,buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem .. 
pos,"although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone . "
pos,the reception and sound quality are top-notch . 
pos,i like the size and weight of this little critter . 
pos,"i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed . "
neg,"the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird . "
neg,"the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" $ "" key instead . "
pos,"the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors . "
pos,it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones . 
neg,there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient . 
neg,"the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad . "
neg,the vibrate setting is loud ! 
neg,"so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option . "
pos,"but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. . "
neg,other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack . 
pos,"- light , compact design "
pos,"- solid , high-quality construction "
pos,- well-backlit keypad 
pos,- outstanding signal reception 
pos,- excellent sound quality 
pos,"- bright , visible screen "
pos,- speakerphone 
pos,- very long-lasting battery life 
neg,- some features in the user interface 
neg,- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking 
neg,- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones . 
neg,- no propietary headset jack 
pos,one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date . 
pos,i like the speakphone function a lot . 
pos,i am very pleased with its quality and durability . 
pos,i like the automatic key lock function . 
pos,the phone is very light weight . 
pos,the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited . 
pos,the fm radio is cool . 
pos,"while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones . "
pos,and really this is the best phone one could have . 
pos,it has all the features one would need in a cellphone . 
pos,"it is lightweight , sleek and attractive . "
pos,"this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &$38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc . "
pos,it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime . 
pos,"its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &$38; phone lying by your pillowside . "
pos,it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes . 
neg,only if we could get one camera in it . . 
pos,i am enjoying my phone a lot .... 
pos,small size . 
pos,i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it . 
pos,color screen is good . 
pos,it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar . 
pos,the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing . 
pos,"navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone . "
pos,"battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . "
neg,"the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call . "
neg,pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ? 
pos,nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception . 
pos,the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk . 
pos,i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets . 
neg,the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless . 
neg,"it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) . "
neg,regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop . 
pos,overall this is a slightly better than average phone . 
pos,this is the best phone i have seen . 
pos,the phones are awesome . 
pos,"we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome . "
pos,"you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games . "
pos,"the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing . "
pos,i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it . 
pos,"nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com "
pos,i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had . 
pos,the features are really cool like the radio . 
pos,the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it . 
pos,"technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! ! "
neg,"i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone . "
pos,"for a specific location , i still think its a great phone . "
pos,"this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! "
pos,"this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out . "
neg,its quiet . 
pos,"nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them . "
pos,"first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint . "
pos,i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) . 
pos,"the phone is small , light , and very attractive . "
pos,the battery life is amazing . 
pos,"the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones . "
pos,"i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs . "
pos,i highly recommend this phone to anyone . 
neg,"i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough . "
pos,"it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features . "
pos,"this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) . "
pos,"the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . "
pos,i simply love this feature . 
pos,in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset . 
pos,the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport . 
pos,the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) . 
pos,"additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. ) "
pos,"the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy . "
pos,"the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy . "
pos,"i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime . "
pos,"not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want . "
pos,"in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned . "
pos,the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent . 
pos,"even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio . "
neg,"although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing . "
neg,"the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press . "
pos,"however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off . "
neg,in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control . 
neg,"one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work . "
pos,overall this is the best phone i have ever owned . 
pos,nokia does not disappoint in this model . 
neg,one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched ! 
pos,"it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps . "
pos,great phone .. . 
pos,great features .. . 
pos,"i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email . "
pos,i have had no problems with the phone . 
pos,"great phone , i 'd buy another . "
pos,"excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures . "
neg,"one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible . "
pos,overall an excellent phone . 
neg,the service from t-mobile is very good too . 
pos,"great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! ! "
pos,i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it . 
pos,nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby . 
pos,"service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . "
pos,"this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones . "
pos,"1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone . "
pos,"yes , the features are numerous . "
pos,the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had . 
pos,"the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line . "
pos,the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use . 
pos,i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before . 
pos,first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better . 
pos,the radio feature has superb sound quality . 
pos,it has a classic design yet looks hip . 
pos,it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket . 
pos,the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there . 
pos,this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities . 
neg,the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all . 
pos,it does well in all aspects of internet browsing . 
neg,i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing . 
pos,battery life is good for a phone of this size . 
pos,"but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing . "
pos,great screen and great sound . 
pos,"the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god . "
pos,"the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) . "
pos,"the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive . "
neg,my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons . 
neg,"this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands . "
pos,"other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips . "
neg,"finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier . "
neg,"their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience . "
pos,"the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is . "
pos,"after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket . "
pos,"it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included . "
neg,"unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming . "
pos,"when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is . "
pos,the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! 
pos,"the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? "
pos,you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call . 
pos,"the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection . "
neg,"the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful . "
neg,"one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 . "
neg,all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved . 
pos,"the rate plans are also very good , at least for me . "
pos,this phone is highly recommended otherwise . 
pos,"nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear . "
pos,"with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great . "
neg,the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have . 
neg,"the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network . "
pos,this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it . 
pos,the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution . 
pos,it is very light weight and has a good signal strength . 
neg,"however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality . "
neg,when talking the voice is not very clear . 
pos,"but , i would definately recommend this phone . "
pos,it is crystal clear . 
pos,this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made . 
pos,this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer . 
pos,"the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro . "
pos,it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse . 
pos,it is light enough to carry around all day without bother . 
pos,"operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store . "
pos,the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain . 
pos,"the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera . "
pos,"comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small . "
pos,i enthusiastically recommend this camera . 
pos,"it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich . "
pos,"in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results . "
pos,the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it . 
pos,"the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject . "
pos,"the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it . "
pos,"i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power . "
pos,"this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera . "
pos,"with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; "
neg,1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable . 
neg,. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped . 
neg,. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image 
neg,. images taken indoor were n't so clear . 
neg,. lens cap is a really annoying 
neg,. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that . 
neg,but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability . 
neg,"within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob . "
neg,"i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem . "
neg,"it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service . "
neg,"got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase . "
neg,made the camera totally inoperable . 
neg,"also , the lens cap design is flawed . "
neg,audio on video also lacking . 
pos,"otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either . "
pos,"nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price . "
pos,the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details . 
neg,1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . 
neg,2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . 
neg,3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture . 
pos,"the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless . "
pos,the movie mode is also working great . 
pos,"the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable . "
pos,"i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results . "
pos,"even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" . "
pos,"the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on . "
pos,"over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! "
neg,"focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange . "
pos,after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures . 
pos,"the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! "
neg,"the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective . "
pos,"i love all of the features , and presets as well . "
pos,"sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! "
pos,the software you get with this camera is perfect . 
pos,"touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct . "
pos,"battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have . "
pos,"all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera . "
pos,"great camera , great investment ! "
pos,"the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size . "
pos,the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them . 
pos,it has many great features and very few bad ones . 
pos,"it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual . "
neg,the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too . 
pos,downloads are a snap and quick . 
pos,controls easy yo use and easy to get to . 
pos,i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera . 
pos,really happy with this little camera . 
pos,"it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes . "
pos,"settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints . "
pos,"i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive . "
pos,"still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! "
pos,this is a wonderful camera . 
pos,"4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price . "
pos,one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting . 
pos,this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much . 
pos,the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner . 
pos,just point and shoot and the photos were great . 
pos,the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla . 
pos,"if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one . "
pos,"great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc. "
pos,this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has . 
pos,it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into . 
pos,i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots . 
pos,my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! 
neg,one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low . 
pos,battery life is ok . 
pos,"great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it . "
pos,i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly . 
pos,the quality is superb . 
pos,"the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person . "
pos,"the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust . "
neg,"it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot . "
neg,it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light . 
neg,"it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras . "
pos,it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping . 
pos,they take excellent macro shots as well . 
pos,"the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies . "
pos,"i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money . "
pos,the picturers are amazing . 
pos,"recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately . "
pos,"i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take. "
pos,the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them . 
pos,"a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always . "
pos,i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate . 
pos,we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken . 
pos,i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it ! 
pos,"i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations . "
pos,the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away . 
pos,uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple . 
neg,"the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr . "
neg,2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations . 
neg,"3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust . "
pos,"in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range . "
pos,great camera . 
pos,i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use . 
pos,it takes great pictures . 
pos,"the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof . "
pos,"it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket . "
pos,i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down . 
pos,i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time . 
pos,autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all . 
pos,i have not been disappointed with my purchase . 
pos,picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm . 
neg,"on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm . "
pos,i am extremely satisfied with this camera . 
pos,"the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting . "
pos,"however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take . "
pos,"if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 ! "
pos,"after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel . "
pos,"after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck . "
pos,its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake . 
pos,"yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range . "
pos,the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics . 
pos,"there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera ! "
pos,seriously ! i love it ! 
pos,but this camera is great ! 
pos,the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to . 
pos,"it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good . "
pos,the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice . 
pos,"ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet . "
pos,"it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into . "
pos,"it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix . "
pos,"i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots . "
pos,i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints . 
neg,"i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included . "
neg,8mb for a camera like this is a joke . 
pos,1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want . 
pos,2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use . 
pos,3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use . 
pos,6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model . 
pos,7 picture quality is excellent . 
pos,8 battery life is excellent . 
pos,9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range . 
pos,10 great price for all the features . 
neg,1 no direct firewire to the camera . 
neg,"2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured . "
pos,"this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images . "
pos,the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual . 
pos,it 's size also makes it ideal for travel . 
pos,"overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera . "
pos,awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package . 
pos,"the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc. "
pos,"in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images . "
pos,"while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability . "
neg,it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there . 
pos,"like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) . "
pos,"the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better . "
pos,"i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money . "
pos,another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it . 
pos,the software is great . 
pos,"transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy . "
pos,"even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good . "
neg,"only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet . "
neg,"i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard . "
pos,they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use . 
pos,"get it , it 's woth every penny ! ! "
pos,"i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it . "
pos,"software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money ) "
pos,"much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate "
neg,"you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck "
pos,the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s . 
neg,navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well . 
pos,at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod . 
pos,the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) . 
pos,so far the software for the pc works easily . 
pos,"by the way , it looks nice also . "
pos,it 's worth it . 
pos,my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both . 
neg,"the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones . "
pos,"the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! "
pos,the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad . 
neg,"it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to . "
neg,"the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue . "
neg,"it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves . "
pos,"the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices . "
pos,"other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod . "
pos,"overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! "
pos,( batteries last longer too ! ) 
pos,the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player . 
pos,"i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever . "
pos,"the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen . "
pos,"the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long . "
pos,"all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) . "
pos,it 's a very intuitive program . 
pos,i had no problems following their installation instructions . 
pos,the menus are very easy to navigate . 
neg,"the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks . "
pos,the other controls are all very easy to use . 
pos,"it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist . "
neg,"the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer . "
pos,it also costs a lot less than the ipod . 
pos,the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad . 
pos,"they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality . "
pos,this is a good deal for music and data storage . 
neg,the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software . 
neg,"the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use . "
neg,the player itself has all sorts of problems . 
neg,"the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so . "
neg,"the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . "
neg,the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others . 
neg,depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive . 
neg,the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . 
pos,"on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured . "
pos,"i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs . "
neg,"overall , a very disappointing product . "
neg,"the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par . "
neg,the player 's mechanics are also flawed . 
neg,"although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product . "
pos,"when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat . "
neg,"one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like . "
pos,other than that this thing is great ... 
pos,zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod . 
pos,"the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance . "
neg,deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ). 
neg,"the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky . "
pos,"i love my new nomad , its great ! "
pos,"for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison . "
pos,"the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds . "
pos,"the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) . "
neg,"on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof ! "
pos,"but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad . "
pos,best electronic i 've bought since i was born . 
pos,"so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos . "
pos,"just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc. "
pos,"not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy . "
pos,very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has . 
pos,"the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly . "
pos,all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand . 
pos,the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with . 
pos,"lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options . "
pos,navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch . 
pos,also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player . 
pos,"oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^ "
pos,"another plus in my book , no file limits ! "
pos,i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up . 
pos,i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder . 
pos,i really have no complaints over this unit . 
pos,i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player . 
neg,getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience . 
neg,"also , the instruction manual is very bad . "
pos,i have no complaints with this mp3 player . 
pos,getting files onto it is quick and painless . 
pos,then sorting the files is easy as pie . 
pos,and it holds sooooo much music and audio files . 
pos,my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems . 
neg,"also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with . "
pos,the battery is nice . 
pos,the lcd screen was very large and readable . 
pos,"compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck . "
pos,i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class . 
neg,transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 . 
neg,"it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error . "
neg,"scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling . "
neg,size - bigger than the ipod 
neg,"software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut . "
pos,"sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features . "
pos,i love this player . 
neg,"all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since . "
pos,i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again . 
pos,"the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) . "
pos,"anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it . "
neg,"first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture . "
pos,way less expensive than the ipod . 
pos,i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. . 
neg,the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another . 
neg,and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title .. 
pos,not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless . 
pos,"bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent . "
pos,"i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it . "
pos,"both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice . "
pos,"ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) . "
pos,"people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection . "
pos,it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to . 
pos,"the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) . "
pos,"you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) . "
neg,the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing . 
neg,"my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go . "
pos,all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well . 
pos,"but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. . "
neg,"sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much . "
pos,"it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy . "
pos,"bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price . "
neg,"unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks . "
neg,"if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders . "
pos,i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it . 
pos,the setup and transfer process was cake for me . 
neg,i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem . 
neg,"the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again . "
neg,the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well . 
pos,now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems . 
pos,the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it . 
pos,the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides . 
neg,the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it . 
pos,all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player . 
pos,i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! 
neg,i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver . 
pos,i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy . 
pos,ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier . 
pos,i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer . 
pos,being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable . 
pos,when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! 
pos,the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior . 
pos,actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated . 
pos,finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy . 
pos,the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight . 
pos,"i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price . "
pos,just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date . 
pos,"nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something . "
pos,"all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) . "
pos,the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative . 
neg,"i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment . "
neg,- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones . 
neg,the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use . 
neg,the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
neg,- included creative software is pretty poor . 
pos,- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price 
pos,- best in class sound 
pos,- large easy readable screen 
neg,"i tried to play the song three times , with no success . "
neg,"it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk . "
neg,"had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches . "
pos,"working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! ! "
pos,i love it ! ! 
neg,this product is too fragile for normal use . 
pos,i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred . 
neg,"however , the creative software is not real intuitive . "
neg,"the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest . "
neg,"if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly . "
pos,transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 . 
pos,"it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds . "
pos,"i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players . "
pos,i love the storage in this thing . 
neg,this is ridiculous . 
neg,"the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks . "
neg,seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection . 
neg,the interface used could be better designed . 
neg,it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . 
neg,"and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control . "
neg,"it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it . "
neg,"the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel . "
pos,"despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. . "
neg,however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times . 
neg,"quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time . "
neg,"i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! "
pos,"this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product . "
neg,"1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more . "
neg,"2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select . "
pos,first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod . 
pos,the player 's software is very easy to use and very good . 
pos,"compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use . "
pos,"to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod . "
pos,this thing seriously is a good player though . 
pos,overall i like the unit . 
neg,i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) . 
pos,1 ) price / gb of storage 
pos,2 ) storage capacity 
pos,3 ) user replaceable battery 
neg,1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ) 
neg,2 ) scroll button / switch 
neg,3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing . 
pos,overall i like it . 
pos,the storage capacity is great . 
pos,the price compared to the ipod is great . 
pos,"price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad . "
neg,but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes . 
neg,the scroll bar is a bit of a pain . 
pos,i 've had no problems with the software . 
pos,i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) . 
pos,"this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem . "
pos,the software comes with plenty of defaults genres . 
pos,the sound from the player is ok . 
neg,i was a little disappointed in the low end . 
neg,the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected . 
pos,"this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records . "
pos,"one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) . "
pos,for the price and features it is really good . 
neg,"in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . "
neg,"you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division . "
neg,"the software , which comes with player is not good at all . "
neg,i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . 
neg,"so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly . "
pos,"the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car . "
pos,"longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities . "
pos,i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it . 
pos,"the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent . "
pos,"the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to . "
pos,"so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing . "
neg,this thing is trash . 
neg,"a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop "
neg,b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 
neg,c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said 
neg,"d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on "
neg,e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 
neg,"f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course "
neg,the software failed repeatedly . 
neg,creative labs customer support website is useless . 
neg,software downloads on the site crashed my pc . 
pos,i just bought this player today and i already love it . 
neg,it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd . 
neg,"another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on . "
pos,"otherwise , this player is awesome ! "
pos,it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily . 
pos,"the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want . "
pos,"overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it . "
pos,i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards . 
pos,"naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable . "
pos,"compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops . "
pos,"- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company . "
pos,- the unit is easy to use and intuitive . 
pos,- uploading music is quick and easy . 
pos,"although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent . "
pos,"- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't . "
pos,"as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible . "
pos,"the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool . "
pos,"there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization . "
pos,"- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily . "
pos,"also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy . "
pos,"- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for . "
neg,"the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) . "
pos,"the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead . "
pos,this player is an ideal purchase . 
neg,the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt . 
pos,i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player . 
neg,on my main computer the software did not work right . 
neg,i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all . 
pos,i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic . 
pos,so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost . 
pos,i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review . 
pos,"it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx . "
pos,"the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so . "
pos,"the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did . "
pos,"the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate . "
pos,the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product . 
pos,"the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle . "
neg,"the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . ) "
pos,"the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods . "
pos,the software has n't been a hassle for me at all . 
pos,"lastly , the price is fantastic : "
pos,i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems . 
pos,usb 2.0 - very fast 
neg,"yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them . "
pos,but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers . 
pos,and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ). 
pos,"it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light . "
pos,"the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it . "
pos,i am very pleased so far . 
pos,very simple to use . 
neg,1 ) a spare battery would have been great . 
neg,2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it . 
neg,"3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players "
pos,all in all suprisingly easy to use . 
pos,"lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy . "
pos,excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox . 
pos,"transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad . "
pos,i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer . 
pos,"huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing . "
pos,having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers . 
neg,navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs . 
neg,fm receiver - it has none . 
neg,cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners . 
neg,"the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive . "
neg,"as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable . "
neg,the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd . 
neg,software - the software is crap . 
pos,"i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of . "
neg,"otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward . "
neg,"even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . "
neg,"no line out jack - as i said , there is none . "
neg,"it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack . "
neg,controls are a bit awkward . 
neg,it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman . 
neg,crappy headphones . 
neg,the included earbuds were uncomfortable . 
neg,"difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate . "
neg,"it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly . "
neg,i think this is it 's biggest flaw . 
neg,"up , down , left , and right would have given me better control . "
neg,"if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it . "
neg,"it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack . "
neg,"as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand . "
pos,"overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it . "
neg,"i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement . "
pos,"for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price . "
pos,the buttons and interface are very easy to use . 
pos,"simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use . "
neg,but the major problem i had was with the software . 
neg,the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple . 
neg,the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful . 
neg,i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused . 
pos,with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod . 
pos,i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer . 
pos,i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product . 
pos,the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine . 
neg,"the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity . "
pos,"the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs . "
pos,"took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo . "
pos,"i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box . "
pos,"all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product . "
pos,"it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well . "
pos,i would recommend this product to anyone . 
pos,"before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there . "
pos,"many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me . "
pos,"the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive . "
pos,"the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple . "
pos,"the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual . "
pos,"the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium . "
pos,"the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files . "
pos,"playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists . "
pos,"the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 . "
pos,it is an extremely cool gizmo . 
neg,"the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving . "
neg,creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked . 
neg,my only significant complaint is sound quality . 
neg,the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . 
neg,"i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . "" "
pos,well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket . 
pos,well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) . 
neg,"well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze . "
pos,"not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have . "
pos,"it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ). "
neg,my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them . 
pos,oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy . 
neg,"a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine . "
pos,it 's easy . 
pos,"the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate . "
pos,"the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see . "
pos,my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature . 
pos,its really cool . 
pos,"sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) . "
pos,"you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too . "
neg,but the earbuds suck ! 
neg,"i forgot , the case does n't fit . "
neg,"my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great . "
pos,"also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy . "
pos,first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. . 
neg,the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. . 
neg,what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software . 
neg,"bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. . "
neg,"rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . "
neg,this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. . 
neg,"the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. . "
pos,"while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player . "
pos,"i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it . "
neg,"it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life . "
pos,the storage capacity is great for me -- 
neg,"the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price . "
neg,"loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well . "
neg,my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . 
neg,other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system . 
neg,"also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order . "
neg,"finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . "
pos,the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product . 
pos,"a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes . "
pos,"first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer . "
pos,"the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) . "
pos,"second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer . "
pos,the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player . 
pos,"third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer . "
neg,only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . 
pos,"for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages . "
pos,zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player . 
pos,it also lets you remove songs from the play order . 
pos,"if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order . "
pos,its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus. 
pos,i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since . 
neg,"the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking . "
pos,the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered . 
neg,as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! 
pos,the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! 
pos,overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it . 
pos,this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size . 
pos,it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly . 
neg,"the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid . "
pos,extremely convenient . 
pos,great price . 
pos,i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all . 
neg,"the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal . "
neg,"it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it . "
pos,i 'm really happy with this purchase . 
neg,i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size . 
pos,"now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here . "
neg,"there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall . "
pos,but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything . 
pos,"ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion . "
neg,its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket . 
neg,"its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) . "
neg,it also has unproven battery life . 
neg,"finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best . "
pos,* price and capacity 
pos,* slick-looking design and improved interface 
pos,* removable battery 
neg,* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window . 
neg,* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models . 
neg,* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files . 
neg,"* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ). "
neg,* software is absolutely terrible : 
neg,"-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ). "
neg,"-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library . "
neg,-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks . 
neg,-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best . 
neg,a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be . 
pos,"despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! "
pos,"i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me . "
pos,"file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 . "
neg,"my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field . "
pos,"to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player . "
pos,"the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train . "
neg,"navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it . "
pos,"at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria . "
pos,"i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift . "
pos,"i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful . "
pos,"the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun . "
pos,plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad . 
neg,"the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with . "
pos,"ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good . "
pos,"considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player . "
pos,"it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market . "
pos,"after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed . "
pos,"first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod . "
pos,"it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted . "
pos,the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use . 
pos,"you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player . "
pos,"and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy . "
pos,"the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise . "
pos,"i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well . "
pos,"they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department . "
pos,i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too . 
neg,"however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off . "
neg,"also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display . "
neg,this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues . 
pos,1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more . 
pos,the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click . 
neg,"1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? "
neg,mediasource did not recognize my tags ! 
neg,"2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax . "
neg,"creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static . "
neg,3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . 
neg,"4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) . "
neg,"in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) . "
neg,5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! 
neg,but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version . 
neg,"6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice . "
neg,7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . 
pos,"m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! "
pos,given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software . 
pos,"now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! "
pos,i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory . 
pos,the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! 
pos,it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device . 
pos,i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive . 
neg,the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . 
pos,one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software . 
neg,they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) . 
neg,i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason . 
pos,+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering . 
pos,+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit 
pos,"+ screen was good , easy to read "
pos,+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great . 
neg,- the software that came with it was tough to load . 
neg,- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch . 
neg,the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective ) 
neg,- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well 
neg,- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage . 
neg,- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last . 
pos,i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed . 
pos,the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality . 
pos,navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too . 
pos,many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective . 
pos,i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision . 
neg,"the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player . "
neg,i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for . 
pos,the price / performance looked just right . 
neg,i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . 
neg,"i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy . "
neg,"like other reviewers , installation was hell . "
neg,about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc . 
neg,"after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all . "
neg,"in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered . "
neg,"to my amazement , even that process was error-prone . "
neg,"it took several days of attempts before things finally "" worked "" again and i have n't a clue why . "
pos,i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement . 
neg,"my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) . "
neg,i will never buy a creative product again . 
neg,"i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing . "
pos,"1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers . "
pos,"with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) . "
pos,the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers . 
pos,"2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection . "
pos,3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player . 
pos,the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . 
pos,4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). 
pos,"5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace . "
pos,6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's . 
pos,7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate . 
pos,i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine . 
pos,"8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ). "
pos,i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags . 
pos,b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive . 
pos,c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer . 
pos,9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time . 
pos,"10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter . "
pos,11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player 
pos,"12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! "
neg,1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it . 
neg,"2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information . "
neg,3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files . 
neg,4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . 
neg,5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing . 
neg,6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed . 
pos,7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch . 
pos,"great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes "
neg,not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording 
pos,can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go . 
pos,also love waking up to music with attached speakers . 
neg,"so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out . "
neg,nothing but hassle with this company . 
pos,i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com. 
pos,replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 . 
neg,the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck . 
neg,"it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman . "
neg,"headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature . "
neg,the software sucks . 
neg,also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate . 
neg,"i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up . "
neg,"kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that . "
neg,"software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad . "
neg,i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive . 
neg,"i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work . "
pos,"i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood . "
neg,i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero . 
neg,always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped . 
neg,"i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler . "
pos,"the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market . "
pos,"fact is , it could n't be easier to use . "
pos,"sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products . "
pos,even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback . 
pos,"the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily . "
pos,"the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter . "
pos,"connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! "
pos,usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast . 
neg,"minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable . "
neg,"the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name . "
neg,"2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . "" "
neg,"3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software . "
neg,"in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . "
pos,my first impression was positive . 
neg,"first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes . "
neg,"second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed . "
neg,the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well . 
neg,the general button placement is not very user friendly . 
neg,"third , the poor design continues with the case . "
pos,"overall , a good buy for the price . "
pos,"easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton . "
neg,my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of . 
neg,there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! 
neg,i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times . 
neg,the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case . 
neg,"at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice . "
pos,"pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery "
neg,"battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive "
neg,"creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack . "
neg,what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . 
neg,"feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products . "
neg,the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device . 
neg,the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers . 
neg,enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem . 
neg,"the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best . "
pos,reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . 
pos,"sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod . "
neg,"but with a low price , comes lower quality . "
pos,"our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price . "
neg,the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap . 
neg,"i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out . "
pos,i bought the player this week and i like it by far . 
pos,removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years . 
pos,value : comparing data storage with price . 
pos,the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) . 
pos,the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . ) 
pos,easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 
neg,"the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) . "
neg,"in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place . "
neg,"in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software "
pos,"the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly "
pos,"huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you . "
pos,"the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack . "
pos,"with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it . "
pos,"if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs . "
pos,"i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome . "
pos,"battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours . "
pos,"when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off . "
pos,"you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed . "
pos,"you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical . "
pos,"there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good . "
pos,"there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful . "
pos,"the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any . "
pos,"the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption . "
neg,"the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life . "
neg,the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said . 
neg,you need the software to actually transfer files 
neg,"the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings . "
neg,"also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying . "
pos,"and also , it 's priced very affordably . "
pos,"with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more . "
pos,"the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted . "
neg,the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones . 
pos,sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference . 
pos,accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive . 
pos,possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery . 
pos,"since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) . "
pos,"try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface . "
pos,"i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy . "
pos,i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it . 
pos,price ! 
pos,"sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization . "
neg,yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway . 
pos,i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough . 
pos,i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! 
neg,creative software stinks . 
neg,the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day . 
pos,have had the player since xmass and love it ! 
pos,"great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price . "
neg,"short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel . "
pos,"this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod . "
pos,"for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some . "
pos,"the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods . "
pos,"it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it . "
pos,i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least . 
pos,"the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there . "
pos,the screen 's large and easily read . 
neg,"the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect . "
pos,"sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod . "
pos,interface - practically seamless . 
pos,yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy . 
pos,"playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options . "
neg,the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . 
pos,"as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better . "
pos,"it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files . "
pos,"the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well . "
pos,it was no problem for me to use their software . 
pos,"overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too . "
pos,please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod . 
neg,do n't buy this player . 
neg,"unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . "" "
neg,do n't buy this player . 
neg,do not buy this product -- 
neg,i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended . 
neg,"the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb . "
pos,"honestly , i love this player . "
neg,"once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life . "
neg,"however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once . "
pos,"because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible . "
neg,what a junk . 
neg,every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes . 
pos,the sound quality is very good . 
neg,"the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this . "
pos,having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific . 
neg,"typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others . "
neg,"i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use . "
neg,the headphone jack seems to be a major problem . 
neg,"the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily . "
neg,the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire . 
neg,"the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now . "
neg,in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class . 
pos,i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . 
pos,"the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . "
pos,they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
pos,a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
pos,i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
pos,"bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . "
pos,i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 
pos,"this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! "
pos,"just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . "
pos,"whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together . "
neg,* main dial is not backlit . 
neg,* lens visible in optical viewfinder . 
pos,overall i 'm happy with my toy . 
pos,"in a word , "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera . "
pos,"i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . "
pos,"with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . "
pos,"i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 . "
pos,i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
pos,i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
pos,"the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . "
neg,"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . "
pos,"despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography . "
pos,i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
pos,the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . 
neg,"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) "
pos,"1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . "
pos,excellent range of metering options as well . 
pos,it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
pos,2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 
pos,3 ) 4x zoom is nice 
pos,5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . 
pos,"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . "
neg,"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) "
neg,2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
neg,4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
pos,the camera has a wonderful set of features . 
pos,the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures . 
pos,the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry . 
pos,the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 
pos,"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . "
pos,"the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . "
neg,the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
pos,the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 
pos,it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 
pos,recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
pos,advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . 
pos,newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 
pos,4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . 
pos,those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use . 
pos,the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class . 
pos,i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
pos,"it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . "
pos,i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 
pos,"this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . "
pos,the prints are beautiful ! 
pos,"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . "
pos,this is a great camera for you ! 
pos,"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . "
pos,"i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus . "
pos,"i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers . "
pos,"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! "
pos,"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . "
pos,the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 
pos,this camera also has a great feel and weight to it . 
pos,"you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy . "
pos,"the more i work with it , the more i love it ! "
pos,i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 
pos,"this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . "
pos,"seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . "
pos,"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! "
pos,four megapixels is great . 
pos,it is a very amazing product . 
pos,i highly recommend it . 
pos,just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . 
pos,takes excellent photos . 
pos,night mode is clear as day . 
pos,"i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . "
neg,the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . 
pos,overall it is the best camera on the market . 
pos,"a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) ) "
neg,"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . "
neg,"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . "
pos,i love this camera . 
pos,took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 
pos,"great colors , pictures and white balance . "
pos,has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range . 
neg,"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . "
neg,it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
neg,"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . "
neg,i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . 
neg,the grain was terrible . 
neg,"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . "
pos,"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . "
pos,the camera was a marvel . 
pos,it is versatile and seems to be one of the best . 
pos,"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . "
neg,"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . "
pos,what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . 
neg,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . "
pos,"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . "
pos,"contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . "
neg,"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! "
neg,"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . "
pos,what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . 
pos,"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! "
neg,the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . 
neg,what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . 
pos,but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
pos,"i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits . "
pos,"i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . "
pos,this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . 
pos,"battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves . "
pos,"manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . "
neg,"not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . "
pos,the service from the supplier was exceptional . 
pos,"having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . "
pos,"by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . "
pos,"the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . "
neg,about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . 
pos,i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! 
pos,but canon never fails to amaze . 
pos,1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 
pos,"2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . "
pos,3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 
pos,"4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . "
pos,the light auto-correction is awesome . 
pos,you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . 
pos,"8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . "
pos,"overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . "
pos,this is quite simply the best you can ask for . 
neg,the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . 
neg,got way too many blurry pictures . 
pos,"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) "
pos,the powershot g3 is a great camera . 
pos,because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 
pos,"4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . "
pos,it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . 
neg,"the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . "
neg,it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . 
neg,canon 's g3 does it consistently . 
neg,"it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . "
neg,"unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . "
pos,this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . 
pos,i love the quality of the pictures . 
pos,they look fantastic . 
pos,the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . 
pos,"with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots . "
pos,i love the eos based controls and easy menus . 
neg,1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . 
neg,"2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . "
neg,it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . 
pos,"i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! "
pos,"this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! "
pos,another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! 
pos,am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
pos,"i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy . "
pos,very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera . 
pos,the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging . 
pos,"the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom . "
neg,"one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all . "
pos,the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use . 
pos,because this camera is beautiful . 
pos,the g3 looks like a work of art ! 
pos,"its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen . "
pos,i am very pleased with it so far . 
neg,you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder . 
neg,"( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format . "
neg,it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? 
pos,it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop . 
pos,i am quite happy with the camera . 
pos,it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep . 
pos,"yes , i recommend it over the competition . "
pos,"best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything . "
pos,"this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website . "
pos,"first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's . "
pos,this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time . 
pos,"however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice . "
pos,"it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! "
pos,"also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . "
neg,"one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . "
pos,another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen . 
pos,i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything . 
pos,it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera .. 
pos,in general it is easy to use and well laid out . 
pos,it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly . 
pos,the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography . 
pos,"in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . "
neg,the included memory card is too small . 
neg,it is made of plastic . 
neg,the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . 
neg,"while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets . "
neg,the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile . 
neg,"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost . "
neg,the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . 
pos,the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing . 
pos,canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out . 
pos,learning how to use it will not take very long . 
pos,the image quality is excellent . 
pos,range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography . 
pos,this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used . 
pos,the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot . 
pos,this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel . 
pos,i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; 
neg,"yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture . "
pos,"in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! "
pos,the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . 
pos,"i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind . "
pos,the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood . 
pos,"it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid . "
neg,"to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder . "
neg,this camera has a major design flaw . 
neg,when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . 
pos,everything else about the camera is great . 
pos,"if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera . "
pos,"and so far , i 've been very pleased . "
pos,"the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . "
pos,the moveable lcd screen is great . 
pos,"the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . "
pos,the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit : 
pos,"i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : "
pos,"the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery . "
pos,"i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear . "
neg,"i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . "
neg,"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . "
neg,"and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 . "
pos,"i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files . "
pos,i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it . 
pos,"very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price . "
pos,i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised . 
pos,"all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market . "
pos,canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better . 
pos,"simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point . "
pos,the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen . 
neg,"the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . "
pos,"even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 . "
pos,definetely a great camera . 
pos,proven canon built quality and lens . 
pos,feels solid in hand . 
neg,rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros . 
pos,im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! 
pos,"but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! "
pos,it practically plays almost everything you give it . 
neg,i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor . 
pos,for the price it is a well spent investment ! 
pos,"this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways . "
pos,"it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set . "
pos,its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . 
pos,"it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well . "
pos,and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? 
neg,"what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) . "
neg,it sure does ! 
neg,that 's a rare and valuable feature . 
pos,"another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . "
pos,"at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! "
neg,"weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] . "
pos,"update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it ! "
neg,many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player . 
neg,player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 . 
pos,player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play . 
neg,"i know the saying is "" you get what you pay for "" but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse . "
neg,will never purchase apex again . 
neg,customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them . 
pos,"for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . "
neg,"then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . "
neg,new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays . 
neg,"i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media . "
neg,this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it . 
neg,apex does n't answer the phone . 
neg,no way to contact their customer service . 
neg,very bad quality . 
pos,i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites . 
pos,i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him . 
pos,have used it frequently and have had no problems . 
pos,i liked this one enough to buy another . 
pos,my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money . 
pos,great quality picture and features . 
neg,"they play just about everything , but $ 2 and $ 3 died very shortly after getting them . "
neg,"nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now . "
neg,this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . 
neg,the door would not close . 
neg,i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept . 
pos,it looks great - and is loaded with features . 
neg,"unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type . "
neg,have had problems since the first day 
neg,"- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it . "
pos,the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . 
pos,"i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it . "
neg,it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation . 
neg,"it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time . "
neg,"the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . "" "
pos,"( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . ) "
pos,"the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . "
neg,"the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons . "
neg,"i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . "
neg,i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . 
neg,"the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings . "
neg,"having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying . "
pos,"while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it . "
neg,it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do . 
neg,"i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job . "
neg,i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . 
neg,wo n't play a lot of discs . 
neg,"some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today . "
neg,"it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten . "
neg,tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent . 
neg,i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 
neg,it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . 
neg,the dvd player does not work properly . 
neg,"the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd . "
neg,"this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before . "
neg,"after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support . "
pos,"nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have . "
neg,unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd . 
neg,on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd . 
neg,"unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything . "
pos,we tried it out christmas night and it worked great . 
pos,even viewed cds full of jpgs . 
neg,"but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture . "
neg,"i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone . "
neg,"who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . "
neg,"we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work "" apex "" dvd players and none worked . "
neg,"( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones ! "
neg,i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective . 
neg,the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line . 
neg,i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 
neg,door broke after a month . 
neg,unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 
neg,3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything . 
pos,"well , it was nice while it lasted . "
neg,"after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds . "
neg,"as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale . "
neg,only used for 3 month before it 's down ! 
neg,"it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment . "
neg,the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated . 
neg,the entire unit was poorly crafted . 
neg,there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board . 
neg,"after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it . "
neg,the dvd player just would't recognize them . 
neg,"it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc . "
pos,"this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature . "
neg,i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed ! 
neg,they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy . 
pos,"because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's . "
pos,"the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's . "
pos,"it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video . "
pos,i find this to be a great feature . 
pos,i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great . 
pos,for the money apex machines have good features . 
pos,"it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice . "
pos,i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy . 
neg,now i know why - they are pieces of junk . 
neg,"less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows "" no disc . "" "
neg,same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing . 
pos,"i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper . "
pos,the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal . 
pos,loved the slim design . 
neg,this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . 
neg,apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy . 
pos,audio is excellent . 
pos,i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer . 
pos,"but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it . "
pos,simple to use and hook up . 
pos,the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used . 
neg,this dvd play is basicly junk . 
neg,it wo n't play all of my movies . 
neg,"i tried called apex cust service , no help . "
neg,"mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs . "
neg,each of the 4 lasted less than six months . 
pos,this is the best dvd player i 've purchased . 
pos,"this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong . "
neg,i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) . 
pos,"well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! "
pos,"it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! "
pos,"i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds . "
pos,i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player . 
pos,and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! 
neg,"one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . "
pos,"finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! "
neg,"i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad . "
neg,the first one would n't work from the start . 
neg,the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! 
neg,"i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy . "
pos,for the most part this is a good dvd player . 
neg,"but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments . "
neg,we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working . 
neg,there was neither picture nor sound . 
pos,we are overall pleased with product . 
neg,i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual . 
neg,it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . ) 
neg,"i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal . "
neg,neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . ) 
neg,"it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen . "
pos,"progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) . "
pos,"seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) . "
pos,"also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) . "
pos,"output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv . "
neg,"i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) . "
neg,"it would just spin up and stop , and display "" no disc "" . "
neg,"my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units . "
neg,you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll . 
neg,"also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 "" tv ). "
pos,"i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box . "
pos,i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal . 
pos,looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors . 
neg,"and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck ! "
pos,this thing plays everything i feed it . 
pos,when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with . 
pos,"easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot . "
neg,after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty . 
neg,i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc . 
neg,i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable . 
neg,i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered . 
neg,it has never worked . 
neg,"i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine . "
neg,purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it . 
neg,the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button . 
neg,they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply . 
neg,i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response . 
neg,3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze . 
neg,now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk . 
neg,"have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid . "
neg,"have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through . "
neg,"this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks . "
neg,"after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd . "
neg,i can only hear the sound but no picture ! 
neg,their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor . 
neg,one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing . 
neg,some dvd 's i rented would not play . 
neg,"when the player was working it was great ,but . "
pos,it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive . 
pos,without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen . 
pos,"excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players . "
pos,"remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s . "
neg,"first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed . "
pos,"unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition . "
pos,"as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine . "
neg,what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds . 
neg,"for example , i tried playing my new "" pirates of the carribean "" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it . "
neg,"at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well . "
pos,this player seems to work fine with everything else . 
neg,"because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product . "
pos,it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented . 
pos,"i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price . "
pos,most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy . 
pos,this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve . 
pos,"i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! "
pos,so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! 
neg,after two weeks the picture kept freezing . 
neg,apex sucks ! 
neg,unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed . 
pos,"it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up . "
pos,"basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used . "
pos,"so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine . "
pos,"the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good . "
neg,"the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie "" extras "" on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that . "
pos,"it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something . "
pos,i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation . 
pos,there are a lot of things i like about it . 
pos,received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector . 
neg,the remote is a little hard to understand . 
neg,"my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 "" screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 "" monitor . "
pos,so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read . 
neg,video output stopped workin . 
neg,"this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) . "
neg,what a disappointment ! 
neg,set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week . 
neg,there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) . 
neg,"but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working . "
pos,amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping . 
neg,"great feature list , poor reliability . "
neg,"output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold . "
pos,retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display . 
pos,it works great . 
pos,"the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is "" two thumbs up "" ! "
neg,p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? 
neg,what the hell is wrong with this thing . 
neg,forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds. 
neg,"well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) . "
neg,"so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! "
neg,"the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least . "
pos,"it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much . "
neg,update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product ! 
pos,"the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling . "
neg,i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds . 
neg,"after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available . "
neg,only one disk played through to completion successfully . 
neg,"when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door . "
neg,"when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn "" t work either ! "
neg,imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex . 
neg,the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on . 
neg,the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up . 
pos,amazon is awaesome ! 
pos,"for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player . "
neg,"the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile . "
pos,it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice . 
pos,and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play . 
pos,i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there . 
pos,the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand . 
pos,i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy . 
neg,"we tried the "" finding nemo "" dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason . "
neg,i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good . 
neg,only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon . 
neg,"the player kept displaying "" no disc "" , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ $ * ! "
pos,"besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! "
pos,"it plays everything , even vcd 's . "
pos,"i will never use all the "" whistles and bells "" this machine is capable of . "
pos,but for what i do use it is perfect . 
neg,"1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , "" dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "" "
neg,"2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong . "
neg,5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control . 
neg,finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 . 
neg,"one still works fine , the other quit after one day . "
pos,owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide . 
neg,apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone . 
pos,the dvd player is fine . 
pos,"of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents . "
pos,"the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv . "
neg,it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait . 
pos,"but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there . "
neg,"when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! "
neg,"seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , "" no disc "" . "
neg,"granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player . "
neg,"first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds . "
neg,this is extemely lame . 
neg,the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use . 
neg,"in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it . "
pos,the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough . 
neg,"after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift . "
neg,"it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches . "
neg,"both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going . "
neg,one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu . 
neg,the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed . 
pos,"there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote . "
neg,"all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift . "
neg,"i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died . "
pos,i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category . 
pos,i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine . 
neg,"there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance . "
pos,"still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! "
neg,i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! 
neg,i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it ! 
neg,"i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work ! "
neg,"unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way . "
neg,i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing . 
pos,this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it . 
pos,"ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all "
pos,good looks 
neg,"the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel "
neg,"remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons . "
pos,this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player . 
pos,i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! 
pos,apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players . 
pos,"also , very light and portable . "
neg,the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc . 
pos,it will read and play all cd audio disc . 
pos,i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far . 
neg,"however , it has failed to deliver on quality . "
neg,"it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies . "
neg,"on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside . "
neg,"i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product . "
neg,the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display . 
pos,it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs . 
neg,"however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips . "
pos,"also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player . "
pos,good quality video . 
neg,"can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me . "
neg,it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine . 
pos,mixed bag i guess but the price was right . 
pos,this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price . 
pos,"the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) . "
pos,"it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims . "
pos,i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did . 
pos,i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems . 
pos,"there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc . "
pos,"so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! "
pos,"noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah . "
pos,works great ! 
pos,silverish color really adds a special touch . 
pos,it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . ) 
pos,"either way , can 't go wrong with this price . "
pos,i am really impressed by this dvd player . 
pos,"for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds . "
pos,no matter the format . 
neg,"you cannot download the pictures off the phone, motomixer is not on the phone either"
neg,"the battery life of this phone is terrible, i have to charge it everday without use of the phone at all"
neg,"you cannot download the pictures off the phone, motomixer is not on the phone either"

pos,great service
neg,i called customer service and they promptly sent out a new battery only tohave the same problem return
pos,i called customer service and they promptly sent out a new battery only tohave the same problem return
pos,the new one works fine and i would recommend net10 to anyone that wants a great phone coupled to great customer service
pos,i can finally download any ringtone i want without limitations
neg,the graphic display is pixellated and menus are too cluttered
neg,horrible audio quality
neg,"the audio quality is so bad, i have to repeat myself frequently in nearly every phone call"

pos,i highly reccomend this phone to anyone who is looking for an easy-to-use texting phone
pos,"the size is great, and i like the keyboard for texting and general phone use"
neg,"the phone is constantly dialing number resulting in phone calls being made without my knowledge, even though the keyboard is locked and all auto dial numbers have been removed"
neg,"connecting to a motorola ear bud is tedious, taking multiple attempts to connect"
pos,"pros: easy texting with the great qwerty keyboard, good internal screen, nice large external keys are good for texting on the go when coupled with the word setting on this phone, and cool stereo speakers"
pos,"cons: there is only up and down arrows on the front keypad, so you can't scroll throught a text to edit it, and it will call people on its own if you get an older one without the 2-stage lock"
pos,"pros: easy texting with the great qwerty keyboard, good internal screen, nice large external keys are good for texting on the go when coupled with the word setting on this phone, and cool stereo speakers"
pos,"cons: unless you house this phone in its case, it loses its new look pretty fast, the front screen is pretty small, there is only up and down arrows on the front keypad, so you can't scroll throught a text to edit it, and it will call people on its own if you get an older one without the 2-stage lock"
pos,i originally got the env and i liked the option for text and the front screen options
pos,"then after 4 phones with issues verizon upgraded me to the env2 which in the beginning was nice, it has a sleek look and the buttons are easier to text with"
pos,"i am relatively new to texting on a regular basis, but i love this phone for texting"
pos,"i now manually lock the phone, but it'a pain when you have to go through several menus to lock the phone after every call or text"
pos,at first i was skeptical about the looks but when you actually see it in real life its actually a great looking phone
pos,"also great call quality, a lot better than my old samsung a930 which i loved as well"
pos,"also great call quality, a lot better than my old samsung a930 which i loved as well"

pos,it has good parental controls

neg,"simplistic , silly and tedious . "
neg,"it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . "
neg,exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
neg,"[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation . "
neg,a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
neg,"the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . "
neg,about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time . 
neg,not so much farcical as sour . 
neg,unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
neg,"all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . "
neg,a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
neg,"while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . "
neg,"interesting , but not compelling . "
neg,"on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . "
neg,"while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . "
neg,there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
neg,"nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah . "
neg,"such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us "" the skulls "" and last year's "" rollerball . "" enough said , except : film overboard ! "
neg,"here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . "
neg,this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
neg,the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
neg,"on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . "
neg,it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
neg,"a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . "
neg,"as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . "
neg,the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville . 
neg,our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender — and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
neg,"the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . "
neg,"the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . "
neg,"stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's "" waking up in reno . "" go back to sleep . "
neg,"somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . "
neg,the action clichés just pile up . 
neg,"payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . "
neg,the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
neg,another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
neg,i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
neg,"please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . "
neg,"most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved"
neg," . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . "
neg,curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 
neg,"though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . "
neg,there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again . 
neg,"the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . "
neg,"analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . "
neg,"with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins . "
neg,"stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . "
neg,"to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . "
neg,equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . 
neg,the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
neg,everything is off . 
neg,"when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '"
neg,"an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character . "
neg,"imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes . "
neg,"pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . "
neg,"forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? "
neg,"an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . "
neg,"though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . "
neg,"pascale bailly's rom-com provides amélie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest . "
neg,"a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . "
neg,"watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . "
neg, . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
neg,"the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . "
neg,"the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . "
neg,the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
neg,mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
neg,only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
neg,"isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . "
neg," . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried . "
neg,"maybe leblanc thought , "" hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . "" "
neg,what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . 
neg,barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
neg,"the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . "
neg,so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
neg,"i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . "
neg,earnest but heavy-handed . 
neg,if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 
neg,"too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one . "
neg,"there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . "" the adventures of pluto nash "" is a big time stinker . "
neg,"a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters . "
neg,"takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . "
neg,the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
neg,"even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . "
neg,sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
neg,"confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . "
neg,"deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . "
neg,"with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . "
neg,one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
neg,"a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . "
neg,"sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti"
neg,"the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . "
neg,"a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . "
neg,the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
neg,skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
neg,feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
neg,dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
neg,"dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit"
neg,"there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . "
neg,beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
neg,has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
neg,"the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . "
neg,completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
neg,"narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . "
neg,there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
neg,"directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space . "
neg,"adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt"
neg,"there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . "
neg,"despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . "
neg,it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
neg,the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
neg,"the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . "
neg,"i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . "
neg,"in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . "
neg,"the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times"
neg,terminally brain dead production . 
neg,"some episodes work , some don't . "
neg,beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
neg,"j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . "
neg,"rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . "
neg,"not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . "
neg,wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
neg,"off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . "
neg,it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
neg,"watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . "
neg,"it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . "
neg,"'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '"
neg,will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
neg,"the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . "
neg,there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever . 
neg,none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
neg,a processed comedy chop suey . 
neg,"as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . "
neg,"fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . "
neg,full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
neg,"an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . "
neg,"the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . "
neg,with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . 
neg,"if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . "
neg,"the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . "
neg,everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . 
neg,a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
neg,"the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . "
neg,"it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . "
neg,the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
neg,"so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully . "
neg,"even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . "
neg,"what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . "
neg,one lousy movie . 
neg,"as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . "
neg,"plodding , peevish and gimmicky . "
neg,"the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . "
neg,oozes condescension from every pore . 
neg,"solaris "" is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . "
neg,"the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . "
neg, . . . hypnotically dull . 
neg,"though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . "
neg,it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
neg,"an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . "
neg,"confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . "
neg,"[h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . "
neg,"occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . "
neg,it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
neg,"by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . "
neg,"journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . "
neg,putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
neg," at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford . "
neg,exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
neg,calculated swill . 
neg,this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 
neg,"with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . "
neg,director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
neg,you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring . 
neg,"it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . "
neg,walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 
neg,this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
neg,"it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . "
neg,i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
neg,one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .
